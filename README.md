# dbt Labs Employee Handbook

The goal of our handbook is to create shared understanding of what it means to be an employee at dbt Labs.

We maintain our handbook publicly in GitHub and also host it on a website: [https://handbook.getdbt.com/](https://handbook.getdbt.com/). 

You may notice that some links aren't accessible to everyone. This is because we link to internal documentation like detailed how-to guides to supplement our handbook information.
