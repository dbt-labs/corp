# dbt Labs Code of Conduct

## Introduction
This Code of Conduct (“Code”) is to act as a guide for behavior to assist us all in making good (and legal) decisions, however, it is not meant to be a legal contract. Employees are expected to read and comply with the requirements stated in this Code, as well as all applicable laws and regulations.

This Code is subject to change at any time at dbt Labs’s sole discretion. This Code supersedes all preexisting policies of dbt Labs to the extent that they conflict with this Code. Only dbt Labs may modify this Code. This Code is meant to work in conjunction with the employee handbook, and if there is any perceived conflict between the two, please address concerns to the Head of People, Meghan Colón (or for non-employees to legal@dbtlabs.com).

Investigations and reports will be treated as confidential to the extent feasible and permitted by law. Violation of this Code or applicable laws or regulations may result in disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination of employment.

This protection applies to all employees, agents and customers of dbt Labs.

Employees and other individuals who work for dbt Labs also are prohibited from reporting to work or working while they are using or under the influence of alcohol or any controlled substances, except when the use is pursuant to a valid prescription from a licensed medical practitioner and the licensed medical practitioner authorized the employee or individual to report to work.

It is the responsibility of every employee to drink responsibly at these events. You should not drink and drive. dbt Labs will reimburse you for the cost of reasonable transportation to get you home from any event you attend as part of your work responsibilities. dbt Labs will not excuse bad behavior due to your failure to drink responsibly and we assume no responsibility to monitor or limit your consumption of alcoholic beverages.

## Antitrust
### General
It is dbt Labs’s policy to uphold and comply with antitrust laws. Strict adherence to these standards will help employees and dbt Labs avoid criminal and civil penalties. Such adherence also will ensure that dbt Labs will continue to act as a vigorous but fair competitor within the marketplace.

### Antitrust laws

The Antitrust laws have evolved over a period of many years in response to a need to promote vigorous competition at all levels of commerce.

There are two principal federal antitrust laws that affect your business discussions and dealings:
1. The Sherman Act
2. The Robinson-Patman Act

_**The Sherman Act**_ The most widely recognized activity that is illegal under the Sherman Act is price fixing, conduct which includes agreements or arrangements to "stabilize" prices with distributors or competitors. Less well known but equally illegal, are arrangements, understandings, discussions or "gentlemen's agreements" with competitors about allocation of production, customers or territories. Discussions or "understandings" with our distributors regarding bidding arrangements, agreements to boycott certain customers or suppliers, also are strictly prohibited as a matter of dbt Labs policy. Regardless of how innocent discussions of these topics may seem, they may be illegal.

The Sherman Act also makes it illegal under some circumstances, to require a customer to buy one product as a condition of purchasing another product. Such arrangements are called "tying" agreements and may be illegal. The Sherman Act further prohibits you, under some circumstances, from insisting that customers deal exclusively with dbt Labs and not purchase services or products from its competitors.

_**The Robinson-Patman Act**_ The Robinson-Patman Act is concerned with discrimination in the prices charged to various customers. The basic purpose of this Act is to protect small businesses by requiring that price discounts, favorable marketing programs and promotional services be made available to all customers regardless of their size or purchasing power. There are a number of exceptions to the Robinson-Patman Act. For example, volume discounts may justify cost differentials. A lower price may be quoted to a customer if it can be demonstrated that it is necessary to do so in order to meet a similarly quoted price from a competitor.

## Environment

We preserve and protect the environment. Because our fully-distributed workforce does not commute to offices, we reduce our carbon footprint daily. Recycling obsolete equipment is another key initiative we’ve undertaken. We are committed to finding more ways to utilize sustainable energy, source “green” products, and prioritize reuse and recycle initiatives. We encourage employees to suggest more ways of protecting and preserving the environment.

## Workplace Health and Safety

We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all employees, whether they are working on-site in a dbt Labs owned or leased property or working remotely from home or in a co-working space. dbt Labs provides an annual stipend for employees, which should be used to purchase items such as ergonomic work equipment, proper lighting, or other equipment or modifications needed to allow our employees to work effectively and safely from their chosen location. Because our workforce is distributed, we must rely upon our employees to ensure that work areas are kept safe and free of hazardous conditions. Before starting work each day, please survey your workspace to ensure it is free from any hazards or health or safety risks.

dbt Labs intends to comply with all health and safety laws applicable to our business. If you become aware of any safety-related concern, hazardous condition, or other workplace injury, accident, or illness, you must immediately report the matter to your supervisor or the Head of People, Meghan Colón (Email: meg@dbtlabs.com or Slack: @meg).
