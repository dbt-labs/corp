# dbt Style Guide

## Model Organization  
Our models (typically) fit into two main categories:

| Category | Description                                             |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Staging  | Contains models which clean and standardize data        |
| Marts    | Contains models which combine or heavily transform data |
  
Things to note:
- There are different types of models
that typically exist in each of the above categories.  
See [Model Layers](#model-layers) for more information. 

- Read [How we structure our dbt projects](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview) for an example and more details around organization.

## Model Layers
- Only models in `staging` should select from [sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources)
- Models not within the `staging` folder should select from [refs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref).
- The following are the DAG stages that we tend to utilize:
  <details>

  <summary>Common</summary>

    | dag_stage | Typically found in | description                                                        |
    |-----------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | seed_     | /seeds             | <li> Indicates a data set created from `dbt seed`. |
    | stg_      | /models/staging    | <li> Indicates a data set that is being cleaned and standardized. </li><li> In absence of a base_ layer, it represents the 1:1 relationship between the source and first layer of models. </li> |                                                                                                           |
    | int_      | /models/marts      | <li> Indicates a logical step towards creating a final data set. </li><li>Typically used for:</li><ul><li>Breaking up a very large fct_ or dim_ model into smaller pieces to reduce complexity</li><li>Creating a reusable data set to reference in multiple downstream fct_ and dim_ models</li></ul> |
    | dim_      | /models/marts      | <li> Flags data which is used to describe an entity. </li><li> Indicates a final data which is robust, versatile, and ready for consumption. </li> |
    | fct_      | /models/marts      | <li> Flags data which is in the form of numeric facts observed during measurement events. </li><li> Indicates a final data which is robust, versatile, and ready for consumption. </li> |
  
  </details>

  <details>

  <summary>Uncommon</summary>

    | dag_stage | Typically found in | description                                                        |
    |-----------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | base_     | /models/staging    | <li> Indicates cleaning and standardization on a data set before joining to other data sets in `stg_` models.<li> Typically used when multiple sources are rarely used independently. <br/><br/> <strong><em>Example</strong></em>: <br>Location data in our org is seldom used partially, so we want to create one cleaned data set which puts it all together. <br/><br/> <em>Step 1</em>: Models to clean and standardize each data set:<br/><ul><li>base_location__addresses.sql</li><li>base_location__countries.sql</li><li>base_location__states.sql</li></ul><br/><em>Step 2</em>: A model to join all location data as one entity for use in downstream modeling:<ul><li>stg_location__locations.sql</li></ul> |
    | report_   | /models/reports    | Indicates that a final data sets are being modeled to pre-aggregate reports for use in outside tooling.                                                                                                                    |

  </details>

## Model File Naming and Coding

- All objects should be plural.  
  Example: `stg_stripe__invoices.sql` vs. `stg_stripe__invoice.sql`

- All objects should have a prefix to indicate their DAG stage in the flow.  
  See [Model Layers](#model-layers) for more information.

- All models should use the naming convention `<type/dag_stage>_<source/topic>__<additional_context>`. See [this article](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/stakeholder-friendly-model-names) for more information.
  - For models in the **marts** folder `__<additional_context>` is optional. 
  - Models in the **staging** folder should use the source's name as the `<source/topic>` and the entity name as the `additional_context`.

    Examples:
    - seed_snowflake_spend.csv
    - base_stripe__invoices.sql
    - stg_stripe__customers.sql
    - stg_salesforce__customers.sql
    - int_customers__unioned.sql
    - fct_orders.sql

- Schema, table and column names should be in `snake_case`.

- Limit use of abbreviations that are related to domain knowledge. An onboarding
  employee will understand `current_order_status` better than `current_os`.

- Use names based on the _business_ terminology, rather than the source terminology.

- Each model should have a primary key that can identify the unique row, and should be named `<object>_id`, e.g. `account_id` â€“ this makes it easier to know what `id` is being referenced in downstream joined models.

- If a surrogate key is created, it should be named `<object>_sk`.

- For `base` or `staging` models, columns should be ordered in categories, where identifiers are first and date/time fields are at the end.  
  Example:
  ```sql
  transformed as (
      select
          -- ids
          order_id,
          customer_id,

          -- dimensions
          order_status,
          is_shipped,

          -- measures
          order_total,

          -- date/times
          created_at,
          updated_at,

          -- metadata
          _sdc_batched_at
      from source
  )
  ```

- Date/time columns should be named according to these conventions:
  - Timestamps: `<event>_at`  
    Format: UTC  
    Example: `created_at`
  
  - Dates: `<event>_date`  
    Format: Date  
    Example: `created_date`

- Booleans should be prefixed with `is_` or `has_`.  
  Example: `is_active_customer` and `has_admin_access`

- Price/revenue fields should be in decimal currency (e.g. `19.99` for $19.99; many app databases store prices as integers in cents). If non-decimal currency is used, indicate this with suffix, e.g. `price_in_cents`.

- Avoid using reserved words (such as [these](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/reserved-keywords.html) for Snowflake) as column names.

- Consistency is key! Use the same field names across models where possible.  
Example: a key to the `customers` table should be named `customer_id` rather than `user_id`.

## Model Configurations

- Model configurations at the [folder level](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-configs#configuring-directories-of-models-in-dbt_projectyml) should be considered (and if applicable, applied) first.
- More specific configurations should be applied at the model level [using one of these methods](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-configs#apply-configurations-to-one-model-only).
- Models within the `marts` folder should be materialized as `table` or `incremental`.
  - By default, `marts` should be materialized as `table` within `dbt_project.yml`.
  - If switching to `incremental`, this should be specified in the model's configuration.

## Testing

- At a minimum, `unique` and `not_null` tests should be applied to the expected primary key of each model.

## CTEs

For more information about why we use so many CTEs, check out [this glossary entry](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/cte).

- Where performance permits, CTEs should perform a single, logical unit of work.

- CTE names should be as verbose as needed to convey what they do.

- CTEs with confusing or noteable logic should be commented with SQL comments as you would with any complex functions, and should be located above the CTE.

- CTEs that are duplicated across models should be pulled out and created as their own models.

- CTEs fall in to two main categories:
  | Term    | Definition                                                                                                                                                             |
  |---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Import  | Used to bring data into a model. These are kept relatively simple and refrain from complex operations such as joins and column transformations.                        |
  | Logical | Used to perform a logical step with the data that is brought into the model toward the end result. |

- All `{{ ref() }}` or `{{ source() }}` statements should be placed within import CTEs so that dependent model references are easily seen and located.

- Where applicable, opt for filtering within import CTEs over filtering within logical CTEs. This allows a developer to easily see which data contributes to the end result.

- SQL should end with a simple select statement. All other logic should be contained within CTEs to make stepping through logic easier while troubleshooting.
  Example: `select * from final`

- SQL and CTEs within a model should follow this structure:
  - `with` statement
  - Import CTEs
  - Logical CTEs
  - Simple select statement

### Example SQL with CTEs

  ``` sql
   -- Jaffle shop went international!
  with

  -- Import CTEs
  regions as (
      select * from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop__regions') }}
  ),

  nations as (
      select * from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop__nations') }}
  ),
  
  suppliers as (
      select * from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop__suppliers') }}
  ),
  
  -- Logical CTEs
  locations as (
      select
          {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key([
              'regions.region_id',            
              'nations.nation_id'
          ]) }} as location_sk,
          regions.region_id,
          regions.region,
          regions.region_comment,
          nations.nation_id,
          nations.nation,
          nations.nation_comment
      from regions
      left join nations
          on regions.region_id = nations.region_id
  ),
  
  final as (
      select
          suppliers.supplier_id,
          suppliers.location_id,
          locations.region_id,
          locations.nation_id,
          suppliers.supplier_name,
          suppliers.supplier_address,
          suppliers.phone_number,
          locations.region,
          locations.region_comment,
          locations.nation,
          locations.nation_comment,
          suppliers.account_balance
      from suppliers
      inner join locations
          on suppliers.location_id = locations.location_sk
  )
  
  -- Simple select statement
  select * from final
  ```

## SQL style guide
- **DO NOT OPTIMIZE FOR FEWER LINES OF CODE.**  

  New lines are cheap, brain time is expensive; new lines should be used within reason to produce code that is easily read.

- Use trailing commas

- Indents should use four spaces. 

- When dealing with long `when` or `where` clauses, predicates should be on a new
  line and indented.  
  Example:
  ```sql
  where 
      user_id is not null
      and status = 'pending'
      and location = 'hq'
  ```

- Lines of SQL should be no longer than 80 characters and new lines should be used to ensure this.  
  Example:
  ```sql
  sum(
      case
          when order_status = 'complete'
              then order_total 
      end
  ) as monthly_total,



  {{ get_windowed_values(
        strategy='sum',
        partition='order_id',
        order_by='created_at',
        column_list=[
            'final_cost'
        ]
  ) }} as total_final_cost
  ```

- Use all lowercase unless a specific scenario needs you to do otherwise. This means that keywords, field names, function names, and file names
  should all be lowercased.

- The `as` keyword should be used when aliasing a field or table

- Fields should be stated before aggregates / window functions

- Aggregations should be executed as early as possible before joining to another table.

- Ordering and grouping by a number (eg. group by 1, 2) is preferred over listing the column names (see [this rant](https://blog.getdbt.com/write-better-sql-a-defense-of-group-by-1/) for why). Note that if you are grouping by more than a few columns, it may be worth revisiting your model design. If you really need to, the [dbt_utils.group_by](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tree/0.8.6/macros/sql/groupby.sql) function may come in handy.

- Prefer `union all` to `union` [*](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_example_unionall_query.html)

- Avoid table aliases in join conditions (especially initialisms) â€“ it's harder to understand what the table called "c" is compared to "customers".

- If joining two or more tables, _always_ prefix your column names with the table alias. If only selecting from one table, prefixes are not needed.

- Be explicit about your join (i.e. write `inner join` instead of `join`). `left joins` are the most common, `right joins` often indicate that you should change which table you select `from` and which one you `join` to.

- Avoid the `using` clause in joins, preferring instead to explicitly list the CTEs and associated join keys with an `on` clause.

- Joins should list the left table first (i.e., the table you're joining data to)  
  Example:
  ```sql
  select
      trips.*,
      drivers.rating as driver_rating,
      riders.rating as rider_rating
  from trips
  left join users as drivers
     on trips.driver_id = drivers.user_id
  left join users as riders
      on trips.rider_id = riders.user_id

  ```

### Example SQL
  ```sql
  with

  my_data as (
      select * from {{ ref('my_data') }}
      where not is_deleted
  ),

  some_cte as (
      select * from {{ ref('some_cte') }}
  ),

  some_cte_agg as (
      select
          id,
          sum(field_4) as total_field_4,
          max(field_5) as max_field_5
      from some_cte
      group by 1
  ),

  final as (
      select [distinct]
          my_data.field_1,
          my_data.field_2,
          my_data.field_3,

          -- use line breaks to visually separate calculations into blocks
          case
              when my_data.cancellation_date is null
                  and my_data.expiration_date is not null
                  then expiration_data
              when my_data.cancellation_date is null
                  then my_data.start_date + 7
              else my_data.cancellation_date
          end as cancellation_date,

          some_cte_agg.total_field_4,
          some_cte_agg.max_field_5
      from my_data
      left join some_cte_agg  
          on my_data.id = some_cte_agg.id
      where 
          my_data.field_1 = 'abc'
          and (
              my_data.field_2 = 'def'
              or my_data.field_2 = 'ghi'
          )
      qualify row_number() over(
          partition by my_data.field_1
          order by my_data.start_date desc
      ) = 1
  )

  select * from final
  ```

## YAML and Markdown style guide

- Every subdirectory contains their own `.yml` file(s) which contain configurations for the models within the subdirectory.

- YAML and markdown files should be prefixed with an underscore ( `_` ) to keep it at the top of the subdirectory.

- YAML and markdown files should be named with the convention `_<description>__<config>`.  

  Examples: `_jaffle_shop__sources.yml`, `_jaffle_shop__docs.md`  

  - `description` is typically the folder of models you're setting configurations for.  
    Examples: `core`, `staging`, `intermediate`
  - `config` is the top-level resource you are configuring.  
    Examples: `docs`, `models`, `sources`
- Indents should use two spaces.

- List items should be indented.

- Use a new line to separate list items that are dictionaries, where appropriate.

- Lines of YAML should be no longer than 80 characters.

- Items listed in a single .yml or .md file should be sorted alphabetically for ease of finding in larger files.

- Each top-level configuration should use a separate `.yml` file (i.e, sources, models)
  Example:
  ```bash
  models
  â”œâ”€â”€ marts
  â””â”€â”€ staging
      â””â”€â”€ jaffle_shop
          â”œâ”€â”€ _jaffle_shop__docs.md

          â”œâ”€â”€ _jaffle_shop__models.yml
          â”œâ”€â”€ _jaffle_shop__sources.yml
          â”œâ”€â”€ stg_jaffle_shop__customers.sql
          â”œâ”€â”€ stg_jaffle_shop__orders.sql
          â””â”€â”€ stg_jaffle_shop__payments.sql
  ```

- `dbt_project.yml` configurations should be prefixed with `+` to avoid namespace collision with directories.

  Example:
  ```bash
  models:
    my_project:
      marts:
        +materialized: table
  ```

### Example YAML
  `_jaffle_shop__models.yml`:

  ```yaml
  version: 2

  models:
  
    - name: base_jaffle_shop__nations

      description: This model cleans the raw nations data
      columns:
        - name: nation_id
          tests:
            - unique
            - not_null   

    - name: base_jaffle_shop__regions
      description: >
        This model cleans the raw regions data before being joined with nations
        data to create one cleaned locations table for use in marts.
      columns:
        - name: region_id
          tests:
            - unique
            - not_null

    - name: stg_jaffle_shop__locations

      description: "{{ doc('jaffle_shop_location_details') }}"

      columns:
        - name: location_sk
          tests:
            - unique
            - not_null
  ```

  ### Example Markdown
  `_jaffle_shop__docs.md`:

  ```markdown
    {% docs enumerated_statuses %}
      
      Although most of our data sets have statuses attached, you may find some
      that are enumerated. The following table can help you identify these statuses.
      | Status | Description                                                                 |
      |--------|---------------|
      | 1      | ordered       |
      | 2      | shipped       |
      | 3      | pending       |
      | 4      | order_pending | 

      
  {% enddocs %}

  {% docs statuses %} 

      Statuses can be found in many of our raw data sets. The following lists
      statuses and their descriptions:
      | Status        | Description                                                                 |
      |---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | ordered       | A customer has paid at checkout.                                            |
      | shipped       | An order has a tracking number attached.                                    |
      | pending       | An order has been paid, but doesn't have a tracking number.                 |
      | order_pending | A customer has not yet paid at checkout, but has items in their cart. | 

  {% enddocs %}
```

## Jinja style guide

- Jinja delimiters should have spaces inside of the delimiter between the brackets and your code.  
  Example: `{{ this }}` instead of `{{this}}`

- Use [whitespace control](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#whitespace-control) to make compiled SQL more readable.

- An effort should be made for a good balance in readability for both templated 
and compiled code. However, opt for code readability over compiled SQL readability
when needed.

- A macro file should be named after the _main_ macro it contains.

- A file with more than one macro should follow these conventions:
  - There is one macro which is the main focal point
  - The file is named for the main macro or idea
  - All other macros within the file are only used for the purposes of the main 
    idea and not used by other macros outside of the file.

- Use new lines to visually indicate logical blocks of Jinja or to enhance readability.  
  Example:  
  ```jinja 
  {%- set orig_cols = adapter.get_columns_in_relation(ref('fct_orders')) %}

  {%- set new_cols = dbt_utils.star(
        from=ref('fct_order_items'),
        except=orig_cols
  ) %}

  -- original columns. {{ col }} is indented here, but choose what will satisfy
  -- your own balance for Jinja vs. SQL readability. 
  {%- for col in orig_cols %}
        {{ col }}
  {% endfor %}

  -- column difference
  {{ new_cols }}
  ```

- Use new lines within Jinja delimiters and arrays if there are multiple arguments.  
  Example:
  ```jinja
  {%- dbt_utils.star(
        from=ref('stg_jaffle_shop__orders'),
        except=[
            'order_id',
            'ordered_at',
            'status'
        ],
        prefix='order_'
  ) %}
  ```

- Semantic models are created in the same yml file where you define configs, tests and metrics for your models. There should be one yml file per model.
- This keeps all the semantic models in your project in one place, so you don't have to hunt for them during development.

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ dbt_project.yml
â””â”€â”€ models
    â”œâ”€â”€ marts
				â”œâ”€â”€ finance
					  â”œâ”€â”€ orders.sql
						â”œâ”€â”€ orders.yml #semantic models defined here
    â”œâ”€â”€ staging
			  â”œâ”€â”€ product
				    â”œâ”€â”€ products.sql
						â”œâ”€â”€ products.yml #semantic models defined here
```

### Organizing Metrics

- Metrics are created in the same yml file where you define configs, tests and semantic models for your models.
- Itâ€™s possible that a metric could have components from two semantic models. For example, transactions per customer. It this case we opt to organize metrics by the grain of the table, so would place it in `customers.yml` file

```
â”œâ”€â”€ dbt_project.yml
â””â”€â”€ models
    â”œâ”€â”€ marts
				â”œâ”€â”€ finance
					  â”œâ”€â”€ orders.sql
						â”œâ”€â”€ orders.yml #metrics defined here
    â”œâ”€â”€ staging
			  â”œâ”€â”€ product
				    â”œâ”€â”€ products.sql
						â”œâ”€â”€ products.yml  #metrics defined here
```

### `orders.yml` Example File

```yaml
--orders.yml
semantic_models:
  #The name of the semantic model.
  - name: orders
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: ordered_at
    description: |
      Order fact table. This table is at the order grain with one row per order. 
    #The name of the dbt model and schema
    model: ref('orders')
    #Entities. These usually corespond to keys in the table.
    entities:
      - name: order_id
        type: primary
      - name: product
        type: foreign
        expr: location_id
  #Dimensions. Either categorical or time. These add additonal context to metrics. The typical querying pattern is Metric by Dimension.  
    measures: 
      - name: order_total
        description: The total revenue for each order.
        agg: sum
    dimensions:
      - name: ordered_at
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day 
metrics:
# Simple metrics
  - name: order_total
    description: Sum of total order amonunt. Includes tax + revenue.
    type: simple
    label: Order Total
    type_params:
      measure: order_total
```

### Semantic Model Conventions

- Semantic models should have the same name as the model they're built from. For example, the `orders.sql` model would be named `orders`
- Semantic models should have a description that clarifies what the table contains and the granularity of the data.
- Entities are often created from the ID column. Entity names should be singular, for example, customer, order, etc.
- If you're using `expr` to define a measure or dimension, the new object name should follow the same naming conventions defined in the [Model File Naming and Coding](https://github.com/dbt-labs/corp/blob/main/dbt_style_guide.md#model-file-naming-and-coding) section.

**Example Semantic Model**

```yaml
--orders.yml
semantic_models:
  #The name of the semantic model.
  - name: orders
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: ordered_at
    description: |
      Order fact table. This table is at the order grain with one row per order. 
    #The name of the dbt model and schema
    model: ref('orders')
    #Entities. These usually corespond to keys in the table.
    entities:
      - name: order_id
        type: primary
      - name: product
        type: foreign
        expr: location_id
  #Dimensions. Either categorical or time. These add additonal context to metrics. The typical querying pattern is Metric by Dimension.  
    measures: 
      - name: order_total
        description: The total revenue for each order.
        agg: sum
    dimensions:
      - name: ordered_at
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day 
```

### Metrics Conventions

Metrics fall into four broad categories:

1. Company metrics
2. Team KPIs
3. OKRs
4. Specific metrics related to a product area, business unit, or business function that is not necessarily a team KPI, but important to track nonetheless.

Because of the wide socialization of these docs and downstream usage in the BI layer, consistency and clarity are *very* important. Below are the general standards and examples of how we format and implement metrics at dbt Labs:

- Metrics names must begin with a letter, cannot contain whitespace, and should be all lowercase.
- Label is the name that will be displayed in downstream tools. This should be a name that business users understand.
- The [minimum required properties](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview) must be present in the metric definition
- For up-to-date information on metrics, please see the [metrics docs on defining a metric](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/build-metrics-intro)

### Example Metrics YAML
``` yaml
metrics:
  - name: orders
    description: Count of orders.
    label: Orders
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure: order_count
	- name: order_gross_profit
	    description: Gross profit from each order.
	    type: derived
	    label: Order Gross Profit
	    type_params:
	      expr: revenue - cost
	      metrics:
	        - name: revenue
	        - name: order_cost
	          alias: cost
```
