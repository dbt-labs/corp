Historically this page housed the venerable, beloved, occassionally-controversial-to-leading-commas-enthusiasts dbt Labs Style Guide. We've updated and expanded that to a [new home on the dbt Developer Hub](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-style/0-how-we-style-our-dbt-projects), with recommendations on how you can create and enforce a style guide at your organization.
