## Global Benefits Strategy & Stipend

### Benefits Strategy & Philosophy

As a global company, below are our guiding principles that we follow when designing our benefit and perks programs, globally.

- We strive to provide benefits that are both locally relevant and competitive.
    - Each Country’s benefits will differ based on local norms and local competition for benefits.
- Our benefit offerings and coverage will grow and progress as team sizes grow in each country. This is due to economies of scale and eligibility of various plans we can offer.
    - If local teams aren’t large enough to begin group plans, we’ll provide monthly stipends to cover core benefits (Medical, Vision & Dental - where applicable)
- Values aligned: We are Human → Although we may not be able to implement every benefit or offering,we understand that we bring our whole selves to work and we want to hear and respond to feedback.

#### How does this apply today?

Today our global team falls into one of two buckets. 

**Employed through an EOR (Employee of Record) -** Employees that are hired and work for an EOR are subject to the benefits offerings that are provided through their service. However, we will operate within our philosophy above which means we will elect premium coverage and options as they become available through the EOR. Additionally, all related perks remain available and intact for team members employed through an EOER (ie. Office stipends, Professional Development, etc).

**Employed through a dbt Labs local entity** - Employees that are hired and work for local entities in a country with less than 10 local employees will be provided a locally relevant and competitive monthly stipend amount to reimburse some of the cost associated with finding personal coverage for core supplemental benefits (Medical, Vision & Dental), where applicable. All mandatory benefits, pension schemes, etc. will be provided to comply with local laws and regulations. 

As employee counts grow to locally relevant critical mass for group plans, we will work with our Global Benefits Broker to shop and obtain group plans that would replace the stipend amount. It’s important to note that our employee count has a direct impact on the options and plans that will be available and we will only pursue this when it benefits the employees in each location.

### Local Entity Medical Benefit Stipends

The following stipend amounts have been developed to help cover some of the cost to acquire additional supplemental insurance until we are able to offer local group plans. You can use this stipend to cover core benefits like medical, dental, vision, life & disability for yourself and dependents, if applicable.

#### Monthly Stipend Amount

| Country        	| # Gross Stipend Amount (Local Currency) 	| Local Currency 	|
|----------------	|-----------------------------------------	|----------------	|
| Australia      	| 673                                     	| AUD            	|

| Finland        	| 183                                     	| EUR            	|
| Canada        	| 625                                     	| CAD            	|

### Receiving the Benefits Stipend

The benefits stipend will automatically be added to your monthly payroll. You do not need to request a reimbursement.

### Retirement & Pension Plans

We look to target locally relevant and competitive benefit options. Retirement and pension plans fall under the same philosophy. We are currently working towards getting each required pension scheme and retirement plan solidified and will update here once we have more information.

## Healthcare Benefits (US)

Full-time team members based in the US are eligible to enroll in healthcare benefits through dbt Labs. We provide medical, dental and vision benefits to employees and their dependents as well as FSA, DCFSA, and HSA options. 

Health benefits are paid, in part, by the company. The remainder of the costs is the employee’s responsibility.

An overview of our benefits can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Healthcare-Benefits-Overview-US-650cf65d9612445a8d7ce41e936b307f?pvs=4) and find a detailed overview on our benefits [website](https://app.strivebenefits.com/dbt/home).

The details our benefits can be found on the [benefit website](https://app.strivebenefits.com/dbt/home).

### How To Enroll in Healthcare Benefits (US)

Benefit enrollment takes place through ADP and you can learn more about the process [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4).

There are four separate occasions where team members may enroll in, or change, benefits throughout the calendar year. 

1. [New Hire Enrollment](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4#2eebaae383f64dada3d4652570bdbf73): New hires may enroll themselves and dependents in health benefits online through ADP within the first 30 days of employment. There is a strict 30 day enrollment window. After benefit elections are submitted, enrollments go into effect as of your first day of employment (your start date) at dbt Labs.
2. [Open Enrollment](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4#87c60e30f9b645ef99865ad0c2c75ccf):dbt Labs has an annual Open Enrollment (OE) at the end of the calendar year, typically in November or early December. During open enrollment, team members have the opportunity to review or change their benefit elections. Benefit enrollments go into effect January 1st of the following calendar year.
3. [Qualifying Life Event](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4#32b0e31ce6884a9e95fbb988a7b5d78b):There are times when life changes unexpectedly. Often times, those events may happen outside of Open Enrollment (OE). Enrollment in essential health coverage is allowed outside of OE if you experience a qualifying life event. Examples of QLEs include marriage, childbirth, and loss of coverage. Team members can submit a life event online in ADP. 
4. [Year Round HSA Adjustment](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4#bb07dd31ff8542df92ac1f46a288a88a): Employees who currently have a High Deductible Health Plan coverage selection are able to adjust their HSA contributions throughout the year. This is the only benefit adjustment that does not require a Qualifying Life or Work Event.

### How to Get Support with Healthcare Benefits (US)

### Health Related Travel Benefit (US)

Eligibility Requirement: US employees enrolled in dbt Labs' health benefits.

📌 We believe that it’s imperative that our team members have access to the quality healthcare that they need, no matter where they live. Therefore, dbt Labs will reimburse up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually[^1] for any U.S. team member (including their dependent(s)) who requires healthcare that is not available in their state of residence.

Many states have introduced legislation to reduce or restrict access to critical healthcare, including abortion care and gender-affirming care. This is in direct conflict with our values at dbt Labs and this policy is designed to support access to adequate healthcare for our team members across the United States who do not have access where they live. 

[^1]: Resets with the fiscal year on February 1. 

**Eligible travel expenses include:**

- Transportation (reasonable flights, trains, taxis, buses, etc)
- Reasonable Lodging
- Meals
- Transportation, lodging and meals expenses for one support person who accompanies the team member.

**Who is eligible?**

- All team members or any dependent who is enrolled in dbt Labs health insurance is eligible for this reimbursement; which will be paid directly by us (not by the insurance company). The net total annual benefit (for each team member and their dependents combined) is $4,000.

**In order to maintain privacy and ensure that folks are comfortable leveraging this reimbursement, please follow the process below:**

1. Email receipts directly to Megan Pittman (megan.pittman@dbtlabs.com). Please include a note that the receipts are for healthcare-related travel, but we do not require more information than that.
2. Reimbursements will be processed directly through payroll. 
    1. The Head of People will be the only person with access to receipts and reason for travel and will not discuss or share with anyone. The Payroll Manager will receive only the amount to add to payroll.
3. If you need support relating to out-of-state travel for healthcare purposes, please contact Megan directly.

### International Travel Emergency Health Benefits (US)

Eligibility Requirement: US employees enrolled in dbt Labs' health benefits.

US employees utilizing our health benefits have access to emergency care while traveling abroad. 

Emergencies are generally classified as any symptoms that might be “limb or life threatening”, which could be something like broken limb, chest pain, anaphylaxis/allergy reactions causing severe symptoms, etc. If you are not sure if something is considered an emergency, contact your doctor. 

Both Cigna and Kaiser have access to Registered Nurses who are available 24/7 to assess medical conditions over the phone and make suggestions for care (find these numbers on the back of your insurance card).

Learn how to use this benefit [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Int-l-Travel-Emergency-Health-Benefits-US-Employees-d607183ad6214ccfa853c9b5addb2ff7?pvs=4).

## Retirement (US)

All US based employees have access to an employer-sponsored 401K plan, adminstered through [Guideline](https://www.guideline.com/). 

Immediately upon hire, dbt Labs will contribute 3% of employee’s monthly salary into their retirement account on a monthly basis and employees will be automatically enrolled at 4% contributions, which can be adjusted at any time. 

Employees can additionally opt to contribute up to the federal maximum to their retirement account. dbt Labs will contribute to the retirement account regardless of any supplemental employee contributions.

### Enrollment Process

2. Once logged in, employees can set contribution amounts at any time throughout the year.
3. Employees’s are automatically enrolled at a default contribution rate of 4%.

### Automatic Contribution Amounts

- Employer Contribution Amount: 3% (No employee contributions required for employer portion)
- Employee Contribution Amount: 4% **(can be changed at any time)**

## Stipends

As part of dbt Labs' total rewards strategy, we provide various stipends to help cover some of the cost associated with working from home; as well as supporting our team members' development and well being. These policies apply to all full-time employees that work for any dbt Labs entity or who are employed through our Employer of Record (EOR - ie, Remote.com).

### General Guidelines for All Stipends

- All stipend expenses must be processed using your Benepass card or submitted for reimbursement through the Benepass app. [Learn more here.](#how-to-use-benepass---perks--stipend-platform)
- All transactions over $50 USD or local equivalent require a receipt / documentation
    - All reimbursements require a receipt / documentation
- All full time employees are eligible for these stipends in their first month, regardless of their actual hire date.
- Stipend amounts must be used within their allotted time or the **funds will expire** (ie. Each stipend has as fiscal year (Feb 1-Jan 31) or monthly timeline. Funds not used during that time period will expire and will not roll over)
    - **Expired Health & Wellness Funds example**: On July 18th your Benepass card is charged for your gym membership for $100, reducing your Health & Wellness available funds to $25. On July 25th you purchase a sleeve of golf balls for $15 on your personal card. On August 1st your Health and Wellness wallet’s remaining $25 from July expire and is then refreshed to $125 for the month of August. August 2nd you submit for a reimbursement for the golf balls and the $15 is reimbursed and deducts the $15 from the available $125 August amount.
- Stipend amounts will be evaluated on an annual basis (Key factors - benchmark data, purchasing power indices, budget availability)
- Annual Stipends must be submitted in a timely fashion, best practice is to submit expenses within 30 days.
    - Past 30 day submissions: while you can still submit these expenses past 30 days, this best practice helps ensure we aren’t back-loading and incurring large sums of reimbursements as we close out a Quarter or Fiscal year and timely submissions help with this!
- View a list of **[eligible expenses](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/350f3daf90364931abc7ab91c8922a5f?v=d3e383bfd15b41419355b44e86096a66&pvs=4)**. This list is non-comprehensive and is updated as needed.

## Workplace Rental 

We understand that working from home does not work for everyone. All dbt Labs mployees receive a monthly benefit to rent office space and experience an optimal work environment.

**We offer the following to enable employees to rent workspaces outside the home and optimize for productivity:**

- $250 per month in workplace rental coverage for all employees through [Liquidspace](https://liquidspace.com/dbtlabs/signin?returnPath=%2Fmain) 
- $1500 per quarter workplace rental stipend for Directors (L7+) and above to book large conference room / work spaces through Liquidspace to support in-person meetings for teams

**This benefit is important because:**

- **Productivity**: dbt Lab's remote-first / async culture is designed to allow employees to “work from anywhere” vs just “work from home”.  The ***primary goal*** of supporting workplaces outside the home is to enable employees to build the optimal environment for their work.
- **Community:** Provides opportunities for team members to build rapport with one another, engage cross-functionally, and strengthen a sense of shared values and goals.  

🖐️  In-person / outside the home workplace benefits must not compromise remote employees’ ability to collaborate. Please keep in mind that the main goal of this benefit is to enhance your personal work environment. If you choose to collaborate in a co-working space with co-workers, you are mindful that everyone who needs to be involved in a conversation is.  If your project/collaboration can be accomplished over zoom or asynchronously, then it should be done that way to avoid excluding others. 

### FAQs

#### What is Liquidspace and how do I use it?

About Liquidspace: Liquidspace is an online marketplace for renting workplaces and offices.  It is considered the “airbnb of workplace rentals”  in that it utilizes a number of companies and private hosts to allow for over 10,000 locations to choose from. 

To access Liquidspace, simply login through Okta or [here](https://liquidspace.com/dbtlabs/signin?returnPath=%2Fmain). There is no need to submit reimbursement for this, the costs will be managed within LiquidSpace. 

When you begin searching in your area of choice, you will find desks, private offices, and meeting rooms, along with the pricing (per hour, 1/2 day, and full-day).  You can book spaces in advance and some are even available the same day! 

Please join our LiquidSpace slack channel #liquidspace-workplace-experience to ask questions, share great places to book and find others in your area to co-work with!

#### When should I use Liquidspace vs a dbt Labs office?

When in the vicinity / metro area of a dbt Labs office, leverage the office instead of Liquidspace to the best of your ability. If you are local to an office but the office is full or doesn’t suit your needs (e.g. you need a bigger space for a customer / team meeting) feel free to leverage Liquidspace as needed. 

#### What if I want to rent a different workspace for the day that is not available on Liquidspace?

We do not reimburse one-time workplace rental expenses for locations outside the Liquidspace platform. 

However, if you are looking for a space and there are no viable or available options near you in LiquidSpace, and you can find space elsewhere, you may use your personal card and expense the cost up to $250/month.  Please use the expense code “Office Space” in Airbase. 

#### Can I go over my budget on Liquidspace?

No - the $250 rental benefit is strictly enforced within Liquidspace.  For example, if you have used $230 of the monthly benefit, and want to book a day pass for $35, Liquidspace will not process the rental. 

#### Is there an exception process if I want to rent a monthly space that is more expensive than my monthly budget?

Yes! - If you are a team member who does not have an optimal at-home workplace, **and expects to be going into the office 3 times a week or more**, we want to support you in finding the right work environment! 

Most monthly subscriptions are more than the $250 limit, so Liquidspace will not allow you to book on the company plan.  In order to book the space, you can use your own credit card (on Liquidspace OR another platform) and then claim the $250 credit through Airbase.  You must book an unlimited monthly subscription or permanent desk at a coworking space to be eligible for the airbase refund (we do not offer this for day passes).

#### Non-US-based Employees:

LiquidSpace is available in many countries as well. If there is not a space near you on LiquidSpace, we want you to be able to work from anywhere as well! If this is the case, you can find space elsewhere, pay for your space with your personal card and expense, per month, up to:
