## Global Employment

### Country Hiring Guidelines

[We value diversity](https://github.com/dbt-labs/handbook/blob/main/docs/values.md#we-value-diversity). We have team members in countries and regions all over the world and from all walks of life. As we grow, we will continue to explore our hiring capabilities in a variety of geographies.

All of our roles are remote, however some roles may carry specific location or time zone eligibility requirements. Our [Talent Acquisition team](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Business-Partner-Coverage-Model-0a4ee30503464b3bb101de1d4c3ac5e8) can help answer any questions applicants may have about location after starting the recruiting process.

In the past, dbt Labs would hire in any country, except those we had already determined were not feasible due to certain restrictions. At present, we are focusing our hiring in countries where we have¬†entities; exceptions will be made rarely and must have approval by our CFO*. For exceptions, we ask for a 6 month lead time so that we can properly investigate employing someone in that country and take necessary steps to be able to do so legally.

*To request an exception:

1. Please contact the Head of People with the following:
    1. The country
    2. The role you would like to hire in that country
    3. Why this country over one where we have an entity.
2. The G&A team (Finance, Accounting, Legal and People) will investigate the benefits and risks of entering there
3. The final approval or denial will be made by the CFO

**We currently have 3 types of employment relationships:**

1. Direct employment with a dbt Labs entity
    1. We will explore opening in entities in countries where we have a large employee count or if there is a business case where an entity would be beneficial.
2. Non-resident payroll through our dbt Labs entity
3. EOR ('employer of record') employment through our current* vendor [Remote.com](https://remote.com/), legally, this relationship is a contractor relationship
    1. *Vendor relationship subject to change to accommodate business and team member needs.

üìå For countries where dbt Labs is able to sponsor a work permit, the People team needs to do an assessment of the job to see if it falls into a ‚Äúspeciality work visa‚Äù category. We would need to determine that the team member and their role meet all of the sponsorship criteria. **Please reach out to your [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Find-your-PBP-f54e1de2eefa413bad7eb251a3a7c19f?pvs=4) if you require sponsorship.**

*Note: In some cases, hiring foreign nationals of other countries into positions where they may gain access to proprietary technology or software may require an export licenses. This is not a ban on hiring, but it is highly fact-specific, and must be assessed in conjunction with the People team and Legal team, in compliance with applicable anti-discrimination and employment laws.*

### Global Compensation & Benefits

## Internal Mobility

Internal mobility applies to those interested in applying to a role outside of your immediate team. Typically, the role will need to be an open requisition with an approved headcount.

We post open roles on our internal career site, [Greenhouse](https://app5.greenhouse.io/internal_job_board/). It is regularly updated, and includes roles allocated for the upcoming quarter.

### Eligibility

#### Interdepartmental Transfers

We recommend employees be in their role for at least 9 months before applying to an open requisition within their own department. *(Example: Analytics Engineer ‚Üí Technical Instructor)*

**Why a minimum of 9 months?** Because we recognize that there are more transferrable skills and knowledge that exist across roles within a department. 

#### Cross-Department Transfers

We ask that employees be in their role for **at least** 12 months before applying to an open requisition within another department. *(Example: Customer Support Engineer ‚Üí Solutions Architect)*

**Why the minimum of 12 months?** Because it can take about 3 months to onboard onto a new role and another 3 months to become completely ramped into that role (totaling up to 6 months). We would want someone to be working as a ramped member of the team for at **least** 6, ideally 12 months, before moving on. Additionally, it will take some time to backfill your role; meaning there are more limitations for the team during the transition period and beyond if you‚Äôre switching to a new department. 

**Exceptions:** Changes or movement between teams could happen at any time due to business needs. If your tenure with dbt Labs is less than the 9 or 12 months and you are interested in moving internally, bring this up to your [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Find-your-PBP-f54e1de2eefa413bad7eb251a3a7c19f?pvs=4) - the People Team and your current leadership team will need to approve the business exception.

**Again, please ensure you‚Äôre actively talking to your manager about your career goals and development wants/needs.**

## Making a Referral

Who better to find great people to work here than great people that already work here? We don't currently offer a referral bonus program but that shouldn't stop you from sending any and all referrals our way!

Learn how to make a referral [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/How-to-make-a-referral-3d44f9f6b52e49ba8730a3bb48ed2201?pvs=4).

## Privacy Notices

Please review the privacy notices located [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Privacy-Notices-0103d9266f394dd28c5ab4353a31ff4d).

## Background Checks

dbt Labs is concerned about the safety of its team members and about maintaining appropriate controls to ensure that assets of dbt Labs and our customer relationships and information are protected. To reduce these risks, we will obtain and review background information of all prospective, and, as applicable, current employees.

dbt Labs has contracted with [Checkr](https://checkr.com/) to perform these background checks, which will cover criminal history for the last 7 years, sex offender search, SSN trace, education verification, employment verification and Global Watchlist search. dbt Labs may use the returned background check information to make decisions regarding employment. For certain positions where the candidates financial history is relevant to the position, we may also run a check in the federal database for any financial related offenses.

All candidates who make it to the offer stage with dbt Labs must undergo a background screening according to this policy as part of the employment screening process. All contracts will state that employment is subject to obtaining results from an approved background screening that are satisfactory to dbt Labs. If a candidate is unwilling to follow this process, we are unable to proceed with their candidacy for any position at dbt Labs. In the event the background check is not available at the time of hire (switching vendors or delays in processing), dbt Labs will run the background check as soon as possible. The same adjudication guidelines will apply to current employees as they do with prospective employees.

#### Disclosure and Authorization

Candidates (and, as applicable, employees) will receive an email to fill out the background check application. The application will ask for personal and professional information. The application process includes signing a disclosure and a consent form which explains the rights of an individual undergoing a background examination. The application process is designed to take less than fifteen minutes to complete.

Occasionally, Checkr will reach out to the candidate to retrieve additional information, such as backup documentation to act as proof of previous employment or picture IDs. Proof of employment can typically be provided in various ways, such as tax returns (e.g. W2s), pay stubs, LLC documentation, official company registrations, etc.

Background checks will act as an additional mechanism of transparency and will help to build trust with our clients.

#### Review Criteria

Once the background check is completed, company administrators will review the report and determine if any negative information has a direct connection with an applicant‚Äôs ability to fulfill the job duties with competence and integrity. Criminal convictions that would raise a concern are job-related offenses, including but not limited to: embezzlement, extortion, computer/internet crime, fraud, tax evasion, and violent crimes. In addition, the report should be reviewed for omissions or inaccuracies contained in the employment application or made during the interview process.

## Pay & Equity Bands in Job Offers

### Using Salary Bands

When determining an offer for a candidate, we consider two primary factors to determine the point of offer within the approved salary band.

1. The applicant's knowledge, skills and experience compared to what‚Äôs required for the role.
    1. How does this candidates interview feedback compare against the hiring plan (ex. what are the candidate's strengths and are any tradeoffs being made)
2. Internal Equity - How does the applicant's knowledge, skills and experience measure relative to other team members that are in the same role and where they are placed within the range.

**These factors are considered on a sliding scale when determining the appropriate offer within the established salary band.** 

### Understanding Salary Band & Targets

When looking at the established salary band, we consider 3 main points of the salary band, on a sliding scale, in conjunction with the factors outlined above. 

![Min,Mid,Max](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127452841/225728109-639ee762-dfa0-44bb-9dcb-f45444f90686.png)

1. Minimum: target for applicants that just meet the minimum job requirements and would be considered early in ‚Äòdeveloping‚Äô into the role duties and expectations.
2. Midpoint: Target for applicants that match most of the criteria and are considered readily ‚Äòproficient‚Äô at this level relative to job expectations.
3. Maximum: should be used **extremely** sparingly as an employee who is at or approaching the maximum of a pay range is an indicator that the individual is more ‚Äòadvanced‚Äô or experienced than the job expectations. With maximum or higher end placements, individuals would be quickly approaching a promotion (if internal) or is potentially overqualified for the existing job level which may lead to potentially up-leveling a role, assuming there is sufficient business need.
    -  The question we always ask, as a best practice, when considering an offer at the maximum point in band is - ‚Äúwould this person be ready to move into the next level role within the next 12 months?‚Äù 

### Using Equity Bands

The use of equity bands follows a similar practice as salary bands with a one important difference around internal equity. 

Internal equity is framed around how a candidate compares to the rest of the team, holistically, rather than based on equity. This is because equity amounts & values will continue to change over time and cannot be a direct comparison like when evaluating cash comp (ie. Someone who joined post Series B ‚â† Post Series D)

We use the [Equity Bands](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Equity-Bands-9e74a108170b4674aea4fdb6829038a5) as the basis for the equity offering.

Then we use an internal [Equity Scenario Calculation tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GM9fLEZjUv_T5dVB-6LvVKWkbqq24CD8ngSmYT0PMQ/edit#gid=1621073057) to determine what a candidate should be offered within the equity band (# of Shares, Net Value, Gross Value).
