## Code of Conduct

Review our Code of Conduct [here](/dbt%20Labs%20Code%20of%20Conduct.md).

## Anti-Harassment Training

We are committed to taking all steps possible to prevent employee harassment. Anti-harassment training and policies are either highly recommended or mandated in most countries to guarantee a basic right to be free from bias and harassment within the workplace. We aim to provide best-in-class training and clear policies that support a healthy workplace culture.

All employees must be trained once per year, regardless of position within the company, however, the training course you will be assigned will be determined based on your location and whether you are a people manager or not.

Learn more about our policy [here](/dbt%20Labs%20Code%20of%20Conduct.md#anti-harassment-and-discrimination-policy).

## Corporate Travel & Expense Policy

[Notion reference](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Corporate-Travel-Expense-Policy-9d562e4218c941e4bd6b2710aec82c0d?pvs=4)


### Our Philosophy

We strive to hire people who share our values and we trust our employees to do the right thing. Abuse of this trust is counter to the dbt Labs culture. This policy is meant to act as a guideline to assist employees in making good decisions around the use of dbt Labs’ resources during travel and other incidental expenses.

- **Reimbursement requests for spend are to be submitted in Airbase within 30 days** of when they are incurred. Timely expense submission provides us with expense visibility and ensures we are capturing costs in the correct period.
    - At fiscal quarter ends, the accounting team will request submission of all outstanding expenses to ensure appropriate expense capture in the period.
- Managers are required to review expenses to ensure they are consistent with this policy.
- To maximize our tax deductions, **receipts are required for spend greater than $50 USD** (or local equivalent).

These guidelines can’t cover every possibility, so use good judgment. If you’re still not sure, contact the Accounts Payable team at **ap@dbtlabs.com** or on the **#finance-support** Slack channel.

### **Travel Related Expenses**

Travel arrangements should balance economics, safety, and logistics while still accomplishing the business objective.

- Plan meetings thoughtfully and in advance.
    - To maximize cost savings, flights should be booked 10 days or more and hotels booked 7 days or more from the travel date.
- **Book with Navan:** All business travel (including flight, hotel, rail and rental car) must be booked through Navan which can be accessed through Okta or [here](https://app.tripactions.com/app/).

[Book Travel](https://www.notion.so/Book-Travel-9953198a0c37487db7dfda2c76b6b7e9)

### **Airfare**

As a general rule, all flights should be booked in economy class, with the following exception:

- Travelers booking flights of 5 (five) hours or longer one-way (excluding layovers) may book Premium Economy as available. Business class and First class upgrades are not a reimbursable expense.

Unless provided with other instructions, choose non-refundable options as these are more cost effective than refundable options. 

### **Lodging**

Choose safe and comfortable hotel accommodations near the venue or purpose of travel to minimize additional commuting time and costs. If you need to change or cancel your reservation, it is your responsibility to cancel your stay in Navan prior to your intended travel to avoid “no-show” charges.

### Ground Travel and **Rental Cars**

Business ground travel including train, taxi and ride-sharing (i.e. Uber, Lyft) are reimbursable. Book the most economical option, where available. The use of rental cars or car-sharing (i.e. Zipcar, Getaround) should not be used other than for extenuating circumstances and must be pre-approved by your manager.   Review the guidelines for purchasing rental insurance [here](https://file.notion.so/f/s/c855b532-d661-4f3d-9bb9-5b5bb0ccd908/Automobile_Rental_Guidelines.pdf?spaceId=d044428d-35c1-45b8-8e9c-df25f39d8ced&table=block&id=de51cf76-1f9a-4426-919a-053e22bc5a8f&expirationTimestamp=1679105641189&signature=DKWNsHjDdRkFbO-Im5rk9Pxu2kcfwAJWaYJSXer8gr0&downloadName=Automobile+Rental+Guidelines.pdf).

### **Meals and Entertainment**

Meals and entertainment expenses incurred for business purposes are reimbursable. The names of all attendees (employees, customers, prospects) must be included in the expense notes. 

### **Use of Personal Vehicles**

Mileage is reimbursable for business travel using your personal vehicle (i.e. driving to a customer or an offsite). You will be reimbursed at the applicable IRS mileage rate, which includes fuel costs.  Make sure you have adequate insurance coverage for your vehicle. Your normal commute (i.e. from home to the office) is excluded from mileage reimbursement.

### **Internet while Traveling**

Hotel and airline Wi-Fi internet fees during business travel (i.e., GoGo In Flight) are reimbursable. Hotel and airline Wi-Fi internet fees during personal travel are not reimbursable. 

### **Traveling Parents**

The cost of a [milk shipping service](https://www.milkstork.com/) is reimbursable for breastfeeding parents on work travel.

## Involuntary Terminations

[Notion reference](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Involuntary-Terminations-12bd6115f88e4874a300b272f4aec023?pvs=4)


Throughout this section, the core tension being managed is the tension between the interests of the company and the interests of the employee. Often, employer/employee relationships are zero sum: think Amazon fulfillment center employees. Amazon tries to milk as much productivity out of those employees as possible while paying them as little as possible. Turnover is incredibly high. Workers and the company have a generally adversarial relationship.

That is not the relationship we are interested in having with employees at dbt Labs, and it's not the one that exists today. The company and its employees are *highly aligned—*via equity-based compensation and simply by the nature of the business that we're in (innovation).

But employee termination is one of those areas where the interests of individual employees and  those of the company can become misaligned. Our interest is in navigating this situation thoughtfully and with care, attempting to do the very best job that we can to align incentives even through the end of the employment relationship. 

There are a lot of ways to end any relationship, and we want employment relationships at dbt Labs to always end in the best way possible.

### Types of Terminations

There are generally speaking three types of terminations:

1. Layoffs and business-needs based terminations:
Layoffs typically happen due to economic circumstances. The most common reason a company does layoffs is if it underperforms its financial plan. And there are situations where the needs of the business change and old roles are eliminated or new skill sets are needed. Both of these situations can lead to terminations that are unrelated to the performance of the individual employee.
2. Terminations for misconduct:
Terminations for misconduct are exceptional situations and often result in immediate termination. These may involve things like inappropriate conduct, negligence, and violation of employee agreement, among others. This does not include *making a mistake*.
3. Performance-related terminations:
These terminations are where an employee is not performing in their role and the company decides to terminate the relationship. This is the most common type of termination that arises in the normal course of business.

**The focus of this section is performance-related terminations.**

### On Governing Law

The employee/employer relationship is subject to laws, which may vary based on country, state, and municipality. dbt Labs will, of course, follow all applicable laws in all jurisdictions where we have employees. In any case where something in this document is found to conflict with relevant laws, those laws will govern. On the subject of law, this document is not a contract, and is subject to change at any time without notice.

### A Note on Language

We typically refer to ourselves as a team and to individuals as team members. This language reflects our working relationship with one another—collaborative, collegial, minimally-hierarchical. In this document we use the word "employee" because we are zooming in on the nitty-gritty of the employer/employee relationship, the manager/managee relationship, etc.

We also typically would use language like "let go" instead of the more harsh "terminated." While this softer language reflects the actual emotions experienced by people throughout the organization when a termination occurs, the word "termination" is the more specific, well-defined way to refer to this event and so is used here.

As a result of these language choices, this document can feel a bit cold and inhuman. That's not the intent—the intent is to have a clear, honest, transparent conversation about the topic at hand. Given that, using unambiguous language is important.

### Our stance on performance-related terminations

#### 1. Managers are expected to make employment decisions based on what is in the best interests of the company.

There is a very wide spectrum of employer / employee relationships, ranging from a "job for life" to "terminated the minute you make a single mistake." We are *definitely* not at either extreme end of this spectrum. Given that, the question becomes: where exactly **do** we position ourselves on it?

❗ It's important to reiterate here that dbt Labs is an at-will employer. *The company does not provide a guarantee of employment for any particular period of time, and employees may be terminated for any reason, or no reason at all, within the boundaries of the law.*

In data science, the "optimization function" is the algorithm that evaluates how good a given solution is. Our optimization function is simple: **we make employment decisions based on the best interests of the company**. That may sound obvious—don't all companies do this?—but it's  important to call it out. *Each one of us is employed by dbt Labs today because the company believes we are uniquely qualified to help it succeed*.

Team construction, including hiring, firing, performance management, and coaching, is how the company makes that critical determination: *uniquely qualified to help it succeed*. Here are some questions managers at dbt Labs ask when considering whether to terminate an employee:

- Is this person making everyone else around them better or are they holding their peers back?
- What are this person's qualitative and quantitative impacts on the organization:
    - ...relative to the expectations for their position?
    - ...relative to their goals?
    - ...relative to their internal peers?
    - ...relative to an ideal external candidate for their position?
- What has been this person's trajectory? We prefer to evaluate the slope of a line rather than its Y-intercept.
- Does this person embody and act in accordance with [our values](values.md)?

None of these questions are singly determinative, but they are each useful lenses when thinking about the impact of a given individual and their continuing role on the team.

- **Are employees "replaceable"?**
    
    The above could read as a justification for the company to treat employees as replaceable cogs in a machine—the minute that someone screws anything up, just hire someone new to take their place! *This is not how we see it.* This would be an overly narrow and insufficient interpretation of the company's interests for two specific reasons.
    
    1. [Psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety) is an incredibly important component of creating a high-performing, innovative team. Teams that lack psychological safety don't say hard things, build strong relationships, or take shared risks—all of the things that are absolutely required to build groundbreaking products. Terminating employees, even if those employees were underperforming, chips away at psychological safety. This is unavoidable outcome of a termination, as those adjacent to the terminated employee end up thinking "is my job safe?" We can do two things to minimize these impacts. First, we can be transparent about expectations, process, and accountability for termination decisions (which is why this document exists). Second, we can consistently demonstrate as an organization that we only use terminations as a solution as appropriate and that we take performance management extremely seriously.
    2. People are not actually cogs. Think of all of the things that are locked up in your brain. You possess not only your functional expertise (which is often the first thing we think about when evaluating our own job performance), but also your internal and external relationships, knowledge of existing processes, knowledge of our product and customer, and more. This context is incredibly hard to replace, and replacing it costs real time and money. And time, especially, is a resource that is in very short supply for us today.
    
    It is truly in the best interests of dbt Labs to invest in long-term employee relationships, and terminating an employee really is a bad outcome for the company. That may not make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but it's important to realize that everyone involved truly sees termination as a bad outcome, and one to be avoided.
    
- **How do we square employee terminations with our "We are human" value?**
    
    It's important to highlight this point, as it's a hard and uncomfortable truth: it is a very *inhuman* thing to evaluate fellow humans that we care about solely on the basis of their impact on our organization. Humans in our more traditional social structures—tribes and families—do not act this way, and it is deeply socially uncomfortable to do so.
    
    Without letting this document get too mired down in a conversation about whether modern capitalism is a Good Thing or a Bad Thing, let's instead just all admit that we are collectively employed at a for-profit entity within a capitalist system, and that this is not a surprise to any of us. Fundamental to this is that we need to build the most high-performing team we can. Ultimately we will succeed or fail as a business based on the strength of that team—both its team dynamics and its composition.
    
    Our "We are human" value, then, encourages us in this case to navigate the environment in which we exist with every shred of humanity we can bring to bear. You'll see this reflected throughout this document, and you're absolutely encouraged to suggest ways in which we can do this better. 
    
- **Do we look into options for an employee who is underperforming to transition into a different role on the team?**
    
    We often do. While in practice moves like this are hard to make (so many things have to align!), managers are encouraged to look for other internal roles that the underperforming employee is well-positioned to excel in. If you're currently trying to determine whether there might be a good fit for someone elsewhere in the organization for someone you manage, please contact your [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Find-your-PBP-f54e1de2eefa413bad7eb251a3a7c19f?pvs=4)
    

### #2. Surprises are bad and we will work hard to avoid them.

One of the questions that a termination always brings up for any team is, "If I were about to be terminated, would I know?"  Our goal is to have the answer to this be as close to 100% as possible. **Having an open dialogue about performance between a manager and an employee is the most important part of performance management.** 

Our company-wide investment in quarterly reviews, 1-on-1s, and feedback training demonstrates just how much we care about establishing strong feedback. This feedback is the bedrock on which we have created, and are continuing to create, a high-performing team.

Important to note is that it is both *hard and important* for a manager to directly link a conversation about critical feedback to potential future termination. Sentences like these are important to say out loud: 

- "I'm really happy to work with you on this area but please know that this does need to improve over the next [period] or we may have to talk about transitioning you out of this role."
- "We've been talking about this area of your performance for a [period] now, and I haven't seen meaningful change. If I don't start to see significant change in this area over the coming [period] we'll need to let you go."

Making the link between critical feedback and potential termination explicit is so important because otherwise it is hard for employees to differentiate "standard fare critical feedback"—which is normal and healthy—from "potentially career-disrupting critical feedback." Without a clear ability to differentiate between these two situations, it is only natural for anyone to react to feedback with a "worst-case scenario" mindset, which will naturally lead to low psychological safety and often defensiveness. 

It is our goal to create an environment where receiving critical feedback is normal, and employees don't need to over-index on every piece of critical feedback they receive. It's a manager's job to help create this environment.

- **I notice the answer wasn't "100%", it was "as close to 100% as possible". Are there exceptions where I might be surprised about my performance-related termination?**
    
    There are a few, which include:
    
    - *Sometimes we make hiring mistakes.* We try our very best to assess the fitness of a given human with a given role, but it is impossible to perfectly assess fit during even the ideal interview process. In the first three months of an employee's tenure, it may become clear that they just aren't a good fit for the role and should be transitioned out. Terminations during this period may happen more quickly as new information about an employee's performance becomes available.
    - *Feedback failures happen.* While we strive to give clear feedback that directly links performance to potential termination, we also recognize that managers are also fallible humans. While this is a serious failure on the part of that manager (and will be referenced in their own performance review), this failure should not and cannot prevent us from at all times doing what is in the best interests of the organization.
    - *Sudden or severe downturns in performance.* There can be instances where the performance of an employee takes a rapid change for the worse and it is critical to make a change faster than our regular feedback cadence is wired for to minimize negative impacts.
    
    Our goal is for surprises to happen almost-never, but we also recognize that "no surprises ever" is also not an attainable goal (no more than is "zero downtime"). As in all things, this is something that we are always focused on improving. 
    
- **The thought that my job—my source of income!—is subject to the inherently imperfect judgment of my manager and the inherently imperfect processes of a fallible company makes me queasy. How do we create an environment where I feel like I have some protection against capriciousness?**
    
    One of the reasons that employee terminations are so fraught is a mismatch between responsibility and impact.
    
    - Typically there is some shared responsibility for the outcome on the part of both the terminated employee and their manager / the company. It's not in anyone's interests for an employment relationship to end in termination, so there is a combination of hiring failure, management failure, and individual performance failure that happened to get to that point.
    - The brunt of the impact is always / nearly always felt by the terminated employee. Being terminated is a significant life event.
    - The manager to whom the terminated employee reported is typically very minimally impacted.
    
    This mismatch between who-is-responsible and who-gets-impacted can create a bad situation. In the most extreme case it can result in managers abdicating their responsibilities in performance management altogether and using terminations as the solution for far too many performance challenges. This creates a toxic work environment where employees feel unsupported and always at risk of termination. This is definitely not the outcome we are looking for—purely from a commercial perspective, this is not the type of environment that results in productivity and innovation (see: psychological safety, above). This also just wouldn't be the kind of environment that any of us would be proud to be a part of.
    
    - **Is using a PIP a good solution here?**
        
        One possible solution to this is for the People team to introduce a formalized process that managers need to go through in order to terminate an employee. This is often known as a "PIP"—performance improvement plan—and it typically plays out over the course of 30-90 days. Because the process is run by the People team, there is a level of assurance that the manager cannot act exclusively on their own authority.
        
        The PIP, though, is deeply flawed. It is extremely ritualized, focused on documentation, and impersonal. In reality, companies tend to use PIPs not to help fix performance issues, but instead to document their reasons for terminating someone *after they have already decided to do so*, purely for legal liability reasons.
        
        PIPs have very negative cultural and practical outcomes:
        
        - They are fundamentally disingenuous and encourage "double-speak." We value transparency and refuse to create rituals that undermine this value.
        - They do not actually accomplish their stated goals of employee protection—in practice they serve to protect the company.
        - They prevent the affected employee from having the time to collect themselves and plan out their next moves. The time we choose to pay in severance, a company that uses PIPs is still asking the employee to spend all of their time on a job from which they will be terminated. We would prefer to move decisively and allow the terminated employee to use this paid time in whatever way was the most helpful **to them**.
        - The delay in terminating someone reduces the speed with which the organization can solve problems. 90 days of underperformance in a role is a very long time for a company in hypergrowth.
        
        For all of these reasons, we don't use PIPs at dbt Labs. We do, however, involve the People team in every single termination that occurs at the company to prevent unilateral decisions from being made by managers.
        
    - **What is our preferred way of solving this problem?**
        
        When framing this problem in terms of a mismatch between accountability and impact, it becomes more clear what good potential solutions are. The question decomposes down into two distinct sub-questions: 
        
        - How do we minimize the impact on the terminated employee?
        - How do we increase the accountability of managers and the organization as a whole?
        
        Minimizing the impact on terminated employees is the primary motivating force behind our severance policy. We have a [generous severance policy](#3-a-generous-severance-policy-is-in-the-best-interests-of-the-company-the-team-and-the-terminated-employee) specifically because we want to minimize the impact of a termination on the terminated employee.
        
        Increasing accountability of managers is something we know how to do as well. We employ the retrospective as a tool throughout the company to post-hoc determine the causes of an event. This could be a product outage, a project that failed to be delivered on time, a missed quarter, or (in this case) an employee termination. Retrospectives are an incredibly pro-cultural tool because they do not assume any fault—the goal is simply to determine causation. But in knowing ahead of time that there will be a retrospective conducted, everyone involved knows that they will be asked to give their own account of what happened and why in front of the rest of the group. And while the goal is not to assign blame, the simple act of transparently assessing causation (rather than allowing terminations to happen in the shadows) creates accountability for everyone involved.
        
        We conduct retrospectives for all (or nearly all) terminations that occurs at the company. Each retrospective involves: 
        
        - the terminated employee's manager and the entire hierarchical chain above them, up through Tristan.
        - People Business Partner
        - if the terminated employee was hired in the past 90 days, the talent acquisition partner who ran the recruiting cycle.
        
        Each retrospective will focus around the answers to the following two questions:
        
        - What went wrong that led to this outcome?
        - What can we do better as an organization to prevent this from happening in the future?
        
        To be abundantly clear: **our expectation for managers at dbt Labs is that they use terminations sparingly**. While at times this solution will inevitably be needed, we expect that managers will put in the performance management and feedback work before arriving at this outcome. 
        
        Performance management is the most fundamental duty of any manager at dbt Labs and we have an extremely high bar for the care required to appropriately discharge this duty. This is a significant component of the performance evaluation for managers at all levels of the company.
        
    - **I'm not sure that this fundamentally solves the problem of my uneasiness around this topic.**
        
        That's totally, 100%, reasonable. The employer/employee relationship and the manager/managee relationship have been fraught since the beginning of industrial capitalism. It's important that we do everything in our power to try to discharge our responsibilities as an employer with the utmost respect for our employees, but it's also important to say out loud that these are inherently hard things and we will not always be perfect.
        
        Fundamentally, the only answer that is appropriate to this concern is trust. You either believe you are working for an organization that cares about its people and does its best on their behalf or you do not. It is our job at every point to earn this trust—this is one of the goals of this document!—but it is also your job to engage with the organization openly and in good faith about where you don't feel like the company is living up to your expectations of it today. This dialogue is critical for our long-term ability to earn and keep the trust of all of our employees.
        
        If you do feel like the organization is not living up to your expectations in this area, there are very productive pathways for you to voice these concerns. Talk to your manager, to any member of the leadership team, to anyone within the People Team, or to your [peer advocates](https://www.notion.so/Peer-Advocate-Program-ef66f66a1b2f40a385b2efb578bfb4c1). We really care about this topic and constructive feedback is critical.
        
- **Is there a straight line between "I failed at something / screwed something up / missed my numbers" and "I'm likely going to be terminated"?**
    
    This is so incredibly, unbelievably important! At dbt Labs, *failure does not result in termination* (subject to exceptions in extreme circumstances).
    
    Imagine a company where avoiding failure was the highest goal, because failure meant getting fired. This company is not going to be successful at innovating because *innovation inevitably involves failure*. Failure is just a part of the process of taking risks, of trying new things.
    
    While we try hard to succeed at the things we do, we also have a blameless culture where we learn from our mistakes and continually engage in a process of improvement. And the most important ingredient of that process is open and honest feedback.
    
    The important distinction to draw when it comes to performance management is which situation someone is in:
    
    1. The person is unable to succeed in their role. They are consistently not demonstrating the traits / skills / behaviors required for success.
    2. The person is fundamentally demonstrating the traits / skills / behaviors required for success in their role, but has made some mistakes / has some areas for improvement.
    
    All of us, from the most senior to the most junior, make mistakes and have areas for improvement! It is the responsibility of the entire organization to give each other the feedback that we all need to get better. Withholding feedback out of a desire to "protect" someone is actually depriving them of exactly that most critical of raw materials they need to improve. 
    

#### 3. A generous severance policy is in the best interests of the company, the team, and the terminated employee.

Our goal is to have a top-of-market severance policy in terms of both cash and benefits. In the US, as of this writing, that looks like ~12 weeks of severance (cash) at your most recent annual base salary plus funds to cover your COBRA benefits for that duration (COBRA funds, if applicable, will be added into the severance check). Although subject to change without notice, it is currently our policy to give this to all employees terminated for performance reasons (not terminations for misconduct), subject to exceptions in unusual circumstances

There are two reasons for this why we think it is important to go above and beyond the industry standard of 2-4 weeks:

1. **We exist in an extremely fast-paced, high-rate-of-change environment.** In this type of environment, there is meaningful turbulence both for the organization and for its employees. Having a generous severance package buffers individuals from these effects and allows each of us to feel a degree of financial safety. Individuals lacking financial safety are [not able to be as creative or risk-tolerant](https://www.lse.ac.uk/business-and-consultancy/consulting/assets/documents/how-poverty-affects-peoples-decision-making-processes.pdf). This shouldn't be a surprise—you're simply not going to be your best self if you're worried about paying your bills. Having confidence that you'll be supported even through a termination process allows each of us to do our best work
2. **We want employees to be able to think about the best interests of the company, even if that means their own employment relationship with the company would end.** It is a perhaps-counterintuitive outcome of our "We believe in moving up the stack" value that sometimes the right role for a person isn't with dbt Labs. We adopt an abundance mindset, and are confident that each of us can find the right role, whether at dbt Labs or elsewhere. This severance policy enables terminated employees the space to do just that.

#### 4. The team needs information to move forwards - departure announcement guidelines for managers.

❗ Managers should partner with their [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Find-your-PBP-f54e1de2eefa413bad7eb251a3a7c19f?pvs=4) to draft the message and communication plan.

Our goal with this messaging is to manage the tension between our value of transparency, respecting the privacy of the departing employee, and creating unnecessary stress within the organization. It’s important to communicate departures immediately with those that worked closely with the individual, and we strive to do so in a way that shares the facts, addresses any concerns and allows everyone a path forward with their work.

#### 5. Terminations are an organizational failure and we do not fail silently.

We regularly conduct retrospectives on terminations. The purpose of this retrospective is to evaluate what the company, hiring team, or manager could have done differently to have prevented this outcome or to have arrived at the outcome via a better path. The purpose of this group is **not** to rehash the failures of the terminated employee.

As in all things, our goal here is to be as transparent as possible. In going through these meetings we will look to share as many learnings from these retrospectives as possible without violating employee privacy.

## Background Checks

[Notion reference](https://github.com/dbt-labs/corp/blob/new-handbook-launch/handbook.md#background-checks)

dbt Labs is concerned about the safety of its team members and about maintaining appropriate controls to ensure that assets of dbt Labs and our customer relationships and information are protected. To reduce these risks, we will obtain and review background information of covered prospective, and, as applicable, current employees.

dbt Labs has contracted with Checkr (https://checkr.com/) to perform these background checks for US based employees, which will cover criminal history for the last 7 years, sex offender search, SSN trace, education verification, employment verification and Global Watchlist search. For all non-US employees, we use GoodHire (https://www.goodhire.com/). dbt Labs may use the returned background check information to make decisions regarding employment. For certain positions where the candidates financial history is relevant to the position, we may also run a check in the federal database for any financial related offenses.

All candidates who make it to the offer stage with dbt Labs must undergo a background screening according to this policy as part of the employment screening process. All contracts will state that employment is subject to obtaining results from an approved background screening that are satisfactory to dbt Labs. If a candidate is unwilling to follow this process we are unable to proceed with their candidacy for any position at dbt Labs. In the event the background check is not available at the time of hire (switching vendors or delays in processing), dbt Labs will run the background check as soon as possible. The same adjudication guidelines will apply to current employees as they do with prospective employees.

### Disclosure and Authorization

Candidates (as applicable, employees) will receive an email to fill out the background check application. The application will ask for personal and professional information. The application process includes signing a disclosure and a consent form which explains the rights of an individual undergoing a background examination. The application process is designed to take less than fifteen minutes to complete.

Occasionally, Checkr or GoodHire will reach out to the candidate to retrieve additional information, such as backup documentation to act as proof of previous employment or picture IDs. Proof of employment can typically be provided in various ways, such as tax returns (e.g. W2s), pay stubs, LLC documentation, official company registrations, etc.

Background checks will act as an additional mechanism of transparency and will help to build trust with our clients.

### Review Criteria

Once the background check is completed, company administrators will review the report and determine if any negative information has a direct connection with an applicant’s ability to fulfill the job duties with competence and integrity. Criminal convictions that would raise a concern are job-related offenses, including but not limited to: embezzlement, extortion, computer/internet crime, fraud, tax evasion, and violent crimes. In addition, the report should be reviewed for omissions or inaccuracies contained in the employment application or made during the interview process.
