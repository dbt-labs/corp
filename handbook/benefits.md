## [Global Benefits Strategy & Stipend](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Global-Benefits-Strategy-Stipend-03b4ebfbb278451f894a4cca46c90607?pvs=4)

### Benefits Strategy and Philosophy

As dbt Labs continues to grow and expand around the world, we believe it’s important that outline our strategy and philosophy around global benefits. The following points are guiding principles that we strive towards and will drive the decision-making around our benefits both domestically and abroad.

- We strive to provide benefits that are both locally relevant and competitive
    - Each Country’s benefits will differ based on local normals and local competition for benefits.
- Our benefit offerings and coverage will grow and progress as local team sizes grow due to economies of scale and eligibility in various plans
    - If local teams aren’t large enough to begin group plans, we’ll provide monthly stipends to cover core benefits (Medical, Vision & Dental - Where applicable)
- Values aligned: We are Human → Although we may not be able to implement every benefit or offering we understand that we bring our whole selves to work and we want to hear and respond to feedback

### How is this impacting today?

Today our international team falls into one of two buckets. 

**Employed through an EOR (Employee of Record) -** Employees that are hired and work for an EOR are subject to the benefits offerings that are provided through their service. However, we will operate within our philosophy above which means we will elect premium coverage and options as they become available through the EOR. Additionally, all related perks remain available and intact (ie. Office stipends, Professional Development, etc)

**Employed through a dbt Labs local entity** - Employees that are hired and work for local entities in a country with less than 10 local employees will be provided a locally relevant and competitive monthly stipend amount to reimburse some of the cost associated with finding personal coverage for core supplemental benefits (Medical, Vision & Dental), where applicable. All mandatory benefits, pension schemes, etc will be provided to comply with local laws and regulations. 

As employee counts grow to local relevant critical mass for group plans and will then be able to work with our Global Benefits Broker to shop and obtain group plans that would replace the stipend amount. It’s important to note that our employee count has a direct impact on the options and plans that will be available as well as navigating appropriate economies of scale when determining supplemental benefits.

### Local Entity Medical Benefit Stipends

The following stipend amounts have been developed to help cover some of the cost to acquire additional supplemental insurance until we are able to offer local group plans. You can use this stipend to cover core benefits like medical, dental, vision, Life & disability for yourself and dependents if applicable.

#### Monthly Stipend Amount

| Country        	| # Gross Stipend Amount (Local Currency) 	| Local Currency 	|
|----------------	|-----------------------------------------	|----------------	|
| Australia      	| 673                                     	| AUD            	|
| Germany        	| 183                                     	| EUR            	|
| Ireland        	| 274                                     	| EUR            	|
| New Zealand    	| 730                                     	| NZD            	|
| United Kingdom 	| 268                                     	| GBP            	|
| Sweden         	| 1418                                    	| SEK            	|
| Finland        	| 183                                     	| EUR            	|

### Receiving the Benefits Stipend

The benefits stipend will automatically be added to your monthly payroll. You do not need to request for a reimbursement through Airbase.

### **Retirement & Pension Plans**

As previously mentioned we look to target locally relevant and competitive benefit options and retirement and pension plans fall under the same philosophy. We are currently working towards getting each required Pension scheme and retirement plan solidified. More details will be forthcoming.

## [Healthcare Benefits](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Healthcare-Benefits-Overview-650cf65d9612445a8d7ce41e936b307f?pvs=4)

### [Medical Plans](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Healthcare-Benefits-Overview-650cf65d9612445a8d7ce41e936b307f?pvs=4)

We provide medical, dental and vision benefits to employees and their dependents as well as FSA, DCFSA, and HSA options. Health benefits are paid in part by the company. The remainder of the costs is the employee’s responsibility

Learn more about our medical plans [here](https://app.strivebenefits.com/dbt/2022-2023-medical?country=us).

New hires may enroll themselves and dependents in health benefits online through ADP within the first 30 days of employment. There is a strict 30 day enrollment window. After benefit elections are submitted, enrollments go into effect the first day of employment (your start date) at dbt Labs.

To enroll in benefits as a new hire, existing employee during open enrollment or at a time of a qualifying life event, follow our [guide](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4). Note: Employees who currently have a High Deductible Health Plan coverage selection are able to adjust their HSA contributions throughout the year. This is the only benefit adjustment that does not require a Qualifying Life or Work Event.

**Employees enrolled in our health insurance are eligible for the following benefits as well:**

### Disability and Life Insurance
We provide long term and short term disability as well as life insurance coverage to all US-based employees at no cost. Voluntary, additional, life insurance coverage for employees and dependants is available at the expense of the employee.

### [Health Related Travel Benefit (US)](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Health-Related-Travel-Benefit-1b3541b3eec3444d883de4ecf601dd9f?pvs=4)

📌 We believe that it’s imperative that our team members have access to quality healthcare that they need, no matter where they live. Therefore, dbt Labs will reimburse up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually[^1] for any U.S. team member (including their dependent(s)) who requires healthcare that is not available in their state of residence.

Many states have introduced legislation to reduce or restrict access to critical healthcare, including abortion care and gender-affirming care. This is in direct conflict with our values at dbt Labs and this policy is designed to support access to adequate healthcare for our team members across the United States who do not have access where they live. 

[^1]: Resets with the fiscal year on February 1. 

**Eligible travel expenses include:**

- Transportation (reasonable flights, trains, taxis, buses, etc)
- Reasonable Lodging
- Meals
- Transportation, lodging and meals expenses for one support person who accompanies the team member.

**Who is eligible?**

- All team members or any dependent who is enrolled in dbt Labs health insurance is eligible for this reimbursement; which will be paid directly by us (not by the insurance company). The net total annual benefit (for each team member and their dependents combined) is $4,000.

**In order to maintain privacy and ensure that folks are comfortable leveraging this reimbursement, please follow the process below:**

1. Email receipts directly to @Meg Colon  (meg@dbtlabs.com). Please include a note that the receipts are for healthcare-related travel, but we do not require more information that that.
2. Reimbursements will be processed directly through payroll. 
    1. The Head of People will be the only person with access to receipts and reason for travel and will not discuss or share with anyone. The Payroll Manager will receive only the amount to add to payroll.
3. If you need support relating to out-of-state travel for healthcare purposes, please contact Meg directly.

### [International Travel Emergency Health Benefits (US)](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Int-l-Travel-Emergency-Health-Benefits-US-Employees-d607183ad6214ccfa853c9b5addb2ff7?pvs=4)

US employees utilizing our health benefits have access to emergency care while traveling abroad. 

Emergencies are generally classified as any symptoms that might be “limb or life threatening”, which could be something like broken limb, chest pain, anaphylaxis/allergy reactions causing severe symptoms, etc. If you are not sure if something is considered an emergency, contact your doctor. 

Both Cigna and Kaiser have access to Registered Nurses who are available 24/7 to assess medical conditions over the phone and make suggestions for care (find these numbers on the back of your insurance card).

Learn more about this benefit [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Int-l-Travel-Emergency-Health-Benefits-US-Employees-d607183ad6214ccfa853c9b5addb2ff7?pvs=4).

## Retirement
Employees have access to an employer-sponsored 401K plan. Immediately upon hire, dbt Labs will contribute 3% of employee’s monthly salary into the retirement account on a monthly basis. Employees can additionally opt to contribute up to the federal maximum to their retirement account. dbt Labs will contribute to the retirement account regardless of any supplemental employee contributions.

## [Time Off Policy](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Time-Off-Policy-cb5363a73ca1485dbf94619c4c57aa6f?pvs=4)

In alignment with our core value, **“We Work Hard and Go Home”**, dbt Labs offers unlimited paid time off to support you to recharge, spend time with your family, and/or take care of personal matters. To encourage you to turn off your brain, travel, and spend time with your family, recommend you take a *minimum* amount of vacation days **(2 weeks, aka 10 business days)** each calendar year. 

- We estimate that 4 weeks in a year is a good amount to take off (also based on what we have seen historically); note though that we do not have a cap on the number of days you can take off for Personal Time Off.
- At the end of each quarter, the People team will be sending managers a list of how much time off each person has already taken / planned to take for the rest of the year (based on what is requested in ADP).
- We encourage managers to do check-ins with their team (based on the data provided above): for those not taking time off, managers should seek to understand why this is the case and to help their team member structure their workload or work priorities in a way that allows them to actually disconnect from work to recharge.

We ask that you input your time-off requests into ADP and categorize them accordingly [based on the definitions below](#Types-of-time-off-plans-&-definitions). 

**Please discuss your time-off schedule with your manager prior to taking the time off so we can plan for coverage while you are out**. **Manager approval will be required to take time off!** When planning your time off, we ask that you also be mindful of the major dates and deadlines that may be unique and critical to your role.

When in doubt, please discuss with your manager about your plans

#### ❓When would time off be declined?

- It shows blatant abuse of the unlimited time off policy. For example (but not limited to the following):
    - Using open vacation in place of a leave of absence (see below).
    - Requesting time off that is more than 4 consecutive weeks in duration.
- Amount of (or dates of request for) PTO negatively impacts your team or the company.
- Performance is affected negatively.

#### ➡️ Types of time off plans & definitions

👉 For time off plans outside of Personal Time Off: if you need to take more than 2 consecutive weeks off, your manager or People team will be reaching out to see if a Leave of Absence may need to be utilized instead to support you through your specific life event.

- **Personal Time Off**:  If you are taking vacation or need to take time off work to attend to other personal matters.
- **Sick Time:** If your time off is related to your own illness or a family member’s illness (i.e. care for another family member or taking them to see the doctor), or for you to go see a medical professional. You can also use this category for a mental health day.
- **Jury Duty/Voting**: If your time off is due to jury duty or voting time.
- **Bereavement:** If you need to take off to grieve for a loss you have experienced or to support someone during the grieving process.
- **Volunteer/Service**: If your time off is related to volunteering or community service activities.
- **Other country specific categories**: As dbt Labs has presence in multiple countries, we can’t categorize every mandatory time off type. If your time off is not due to one of the above, please use the “Other” reason code in ADP and put in the comments what it is.
- **Leaves of Absences:** If you need to be absent for an extended period of time due to any reason, it may be better to consider taking a leave of absence. Examples of different paid leave of absence types and policy documents can be found below (paid leave below indicates 100% base and commission payments during these durations):
    
    [Leave of Absence Programs](#leave-of-absence-programs-1) 
    
    - ***Paid Parental Leave** - to be taken within the first year of parenthood; any dbt Labs employees who needs to care for a newborn as a result of birth or adoption is able to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave*
    - ***Paid Medical Leave** - any dbt Labs employee who needs to take dedicated time off to recover from their own medical event (i.e. physical or mental illness, surgery, etc) is able to take up to 4 weeks of paid leave*
    - ***Paid Caregiver Leave -** any dbt Labs employee who needs to take dedicated time off to care for a seriously ill person is able to take up to 4 weeks of paid leave*
- **Company Holidays**: dbt Labs observes a number of public and company holidays every year, and this schedule varies by country public holidays. See [2023 Company Holidays ](#2023-Company-Holidays-1) for days observed. You are asked to observe your local holidays (for the country you reside in).

Note that because in the United States, your time off is not accrued, you will not be paid out for any unused time offered under this policy when your employment with dbt Labs ends.

For international employees, see [below](#International-Considerations-for-accrued-time-and-pay-out-upon-termination-with-the-company) for respective details.

#### 💪 Best practices for being out of the office

ADP has a limitation at the moment, where teams cannot see each other’s time-off requests. 

1️⃣ We recommend that after your time off request has been approved, to note you will be “Out of Office” on your Google Calendar (and make this event public so people can see).

Google Calendar also as an “Out of Office” feature where they can auto-decline any event that is scheduled during the period you are out. This may be helpful for you to set up!

Additionally, some teams may have team time off calendars within Google Calendar. Talk to your manager if this is something your team has; you may be asked to make your out of office dates visible here to help create visibility with your teammates. 

2️⃣ Update your Slack status to out of office. 

3️⃣ Set up an “out of office” auto response to your email for the dates you will be out, and clearly indicate who someone should contact instead.

Learn how to requet time off in ADP [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Time-Off-Policy-cb5363a73ca1485dbf94619c4c57aa6f?pvs=4#b819ac73f9994db6a5f4572571b44cc5).

#### 🌐 International Considerations for accrued time and pay out upon termination with the company

In your employment contracts, you will see that you are eligible for a specific number of annual leave (or holidays) days to be accrued over the course of the plan year (to be used as personal time off). There is a clause in your contracts that once your annual leave (or holiday) entitlements have been used up, you are eligible to take an unlimited number of days, as long as you have manager approval. 

From a logistical standpoint, what you can expect in ADP:

- Your time off balance will show as being accrued on a month to month basis.
    - For new joiners, if you start before the 15th of that month, you will earn an accrual for the first month.
    - For new joiners, if you start after the 15th, you don’t earn anything for that month and instead will begin accruing the full amount the following month.
    - If a carryover balance is allowed in your employment contract, the maximum accrual is 25 days and then will stop accruing.
- You can actually take whatever days off you would like (subject to manager approval) even if your balance in the system does not show you have enough days accrued. You can go into the negative and that’s perfectly okay.

At the end of your employment with dbt Labs, if you have unused time off accrued in ADP, we will pay that amount out to you in your final paycheck.

- If your time off balance is negative, note that we will not deduct any amounts from your final paycheck

**🌍 If you are employed through Remote.com**

The above explanation of how accrued time works and pay out upon termination is the same for Remote employees. This is because in your contracts, you still have a set number of days that is shown. You can take any days off as long as you have manager approval.

**Note that if you are employed through Remote.com, you will need to request your time off in the Remote platform.** 

Please discuss your time off schedule ahead of time with your manager, as they do not have visibility into requests within the Remote platform.


### [2023 Company Holidays](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/2023-Company-Holidays-9e0e48bb8404496a868161e170e0a494?pvs=4)

In addition to our unlimited vacation policy, dbt Labs observes a number of public and company holidays every year, and this schedule varies by country public holidays. You are asked to observe your local holidays (for the country you reside in).

We recognize that there are many other cultural, religious or location based holiday's and encourage our team members to work with their manager to take the time they need.

Employee's who are contracted via an Employer of Record (i.e. Remote.com) Please reference the list of public holidays provided via Remote's Platform.

#### ***Paid Parental Leave***

**Time off & Pay**

dbt Labs provides employees, including employees who adopt a child or become a foster parent to a new child, with twelve (12) weeks of Parental Leave paid at 100% of their base salary, to commence at the beginning of the first leave period OR the day the child is born or placed in their care. Employees may take this leave intermittently, which means taking leave in blocks of time. For commission eligible employees, intermittent leaves may be taken in increments of no less than four (4) weeks. For all other employees, intermittent leaves may be taken in increments of no less than two (2) weeks.

If an employee is eligible for any disability benefits through Unum or the state during their pregnancy disability period, or state paid family leave payments, the employee is required to apply for these benefits. dbt Labs will coordinate with these benefits, meaning that dbt Labs will pay the difference of your base salary and any benefits granted, not to exceed 100% of your base salary. Parental leave granted under this policy runs concurrent with any legally required pregnancy disability and family medical leave taken by eligible employees. Parental leave must be completed within 12-months of the date of birth.

Any unused leave offered under this policy will not be paid out at termination of employment, so dbt Labs encourages employees to use this benefit during the time that they are eligible.

For international employees in countries that have their own statutory parental leave benefits, dbt labs 12 weeks will run concurrent with any locally required leave plans.

**Health Insurance**

If employees and their families participate in dbt Labs’s group health plan, the company will maintain coverage during paid leave under this policy on the same terms as if employees had continued to work.

**Vesting**

Stock options will continue to vest at their regular rate during paid or unpaid leave.

**Return to Work**

Employees returning from Parental Leave will be reinstated to the same position, or if that position is no longer available due to reasons unrelated to the employee’s leave, a comparable position. Employees will receive pay and benefits equivalent to those received prior to their leave.

#### **Paid Medical Leave**

**Time off & Pay**

Employees who are unable to work for more than ten (10) business days due to illness or injury not related to work may be eligible for paid medical leave based on a physician’s recommendation. dbt Labs will provide up to four (4) weeks total of paid medical leave. If eligible, employees must apply for any state and/or Unum disability benefits. dbt Labs will coordinate with these benefits, meaning that dbt Labs will pay the difference of your base salary and any benefits granted not to exceed 100% of your base salary. Medical leave granted under this policy runs concurrent with any family medical leave or any other medical leave taken by eligible employees, unless prohibited by law.

A medical leave is considered a paid leave for a specific condition. As such, employees may be eligible for more than one paid medical leave in a year, depending on their unique circumstances. Note that while an employee may be approved for more than one paid medical leave in a year, this benefit is capped at a total of 8 weeks of paid leave.

**Health Insurance**

If employees participate in dbt Labs’s group health plan, the company will maintain coverage during paid leave under this policy on the same terms as if employees had continued to work.

**Vesting**

Stock options will continue to vest at their regular rate during paid or unpaid leave. Vesting will be paused during unpaid leave.

**Return to Work**

Employees may be asked to provide a Fitness for Duty form completed by their medical provider prior to their first day back. Employees returning from medical leave will be reinstated to the same position, or if that position is no longer available due to reasons unrelated to the employee’s leave, a comparable position. Employees will receive pay and benefits equivalent to those received prior to their leave.

### Paid Caregiver Leave

Employees who need to take dedicated time off to care for a seriously ill or injured person will be allowed to take up to 4 weeks of paid Caregiver Leave. The illness or injury must be a serious health condition (defined below).

Certain personal relationships may be eligible for wage replacement programs through the state. For example, a caregiver leave to care for a parent, child, or sibling, is eligible for wage replacement through a Paid Family Leave program. In those cases, employees are required to file a paid family leave claim. dbt Labs will coordinate with these benefits to ensure that employees receive 100% pay.

A serious health condition is an illness, an injury, an impairment, or a physical or mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider for a condition that either prevents the qualified family member from participating in school, work, or other daily activities. Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a healthcare provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment, incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of “continuing treatment.”

Under some circumstances, employees may take this leave intermittently, which means taking leave in blocks of time or reducing the employee's normal weekly or daily work schedule. An employee may take leave intermittently whenever it is medically necessary to care for a seriously ill individual. Leave taken intermittently may be taken in increments of no less than one week.

#### Miscarriage Leave

Employees who experience or have a partner who experiences a miscarriage are eligible for two (2) weeks of leave paid at 100% of their base salary. In the event that the employee experiences medical difficulties beyond this time frame, they may be eligible for a Medical Leave.

#### **Paid Bereavement Leave**

In accordance with dbt Labs’ open time off policy, employees already are able to take up to two (2) weeks of Bereavement Time Off to grieve for a loss of life. If additional time is needed beyond the two (2) weeks, employees will be eligible to take an additional two (2) weeks to grieve under Paid Bereavement Leave on a case-by-case basis.

Time off granted in accordance with this policy shall not be credited as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime.

### ***Unpaid Leave - United States specific***

We offer the following types of unpaid leave: Medical Leave (FMLA), Discretionary Medical Leave (ADA), Military Leave, and Mandatory Unpaid Leave.

#### **Medical Leave (FMLA)**

dbt Labs complies with the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which requires employers to grant unpaid leaves of absence to qualified workers for certain medical and family-related reasons. The company also abides by any state and local leave laws. The more generous of the laws will apply to the employee if the employee is eligible under both federal and state laws.

Please note there are many requirements, qualifications, and exceptions under these laws, and each employee’s situation is different. Contact the People Team to discuss options for leave.

The FMLA requires private employers with 50 or more employees and all public agencies, including state, local, and federal employers, and local education agencies (schools) to provide eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in any 12-month period for certain family and medical reasons. The 12-month period is a rolling period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave, except for leaves to care for a covered service member with a serious illness or injury. For those leaves, the leave entitlement is 26 weeks in a single 12-month period measured forward from the date an employee first takes that type of leave.

**Employee eligibility.** The FMLA defines eligible employees as employees who (1) have worked for the company for at least 12 months; (2) have worked for the company for at least 1,250 hours in the previous 12 months; and (3) work at or report to a worksite that has 50 or more employees or is within 75 miles of company worksites that, taken together, have a total of 50 or more employees. *(75 Miles radius waved due to fully remote & distributed work force)*

**Basic leave entitlement.** The FMLA requires covered employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to eligible employees for the following reasons: (1) for incapacity due to pregnancy, prenatal medical care, or childbirth; (2) to care for the employee’s child after birth or placement for adoption or foster care; (3) to care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition; or (4) for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to work.

**Military family leave entitlements.** Eligible employees with a spouse, child, or parent on active duty or called to active duty status in the National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation may use their 12-week leave entitlement to address certain qualifying exigencies.  Qualifying exigencies may include addressing issues that arise from (1) short notice of deployment (limited to up to 7 days of leave); (2) attending certain military events and related activity; (3) arranging child care and school activities; (4) addressing certain financial and legal arrangements; (5) attending certain counseling sessions; (6) spending time with covered military family members on short-term temporary rest and recuperation leave (limited to up to 5 days of leave); (7) attending post deployment reintegration briefings; (8) arranging care for or providing care to a parent who is incapable of self-care; and (9) any additional activities agreed upon by the employer and employee that arise out of the military member’s active duty or call to active duty.

The FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a covered servicemember during a single 12-month period. A covered servicemember is a current member of the armed forces, including a member of the National Guard or reserves, who has a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render the servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of the servicemember’s office, grade, rank, or rating and for which the servicemember is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy; is in outpatient status; or is on the temporary disability retired list.

**Benefits and protections during FMLA leave.** During FMLA leave, the company will maintain the employee’s health coverage under any group health plan on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If applicable, employees must make arrangements to pay their share of health plan premiums while on unpaid leave. In some instances, dbt Labs may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage or other benefits for employees and/or their families. Upon return from FMLA leave, most employees will be restored to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms.  However, an employee on FMLA leave does not have any greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave period.

Certain highly compensated key employees also may be denied reinstatement when necessary to prevent “substantial and grievous economic injury” to the company’s operations. A “key” employee is an eligible salaried employee who is among the highest-paid 10 percent of the company’s employees within 75 miles of the worksite. Employees will be notified of their status as key employees, when applicable, after they request FMLA leave.

Use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued before the start of an employee’s leave.

**Definition of “serious health condition.”** A serious health condition is an illness, an injury, an impairment, or a physical or mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee’s job or prevents the qualified family member from participating in school, work, or other daily activities.

Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a healthcare provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment, incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of “continuing treatment.”

**Use of leave.** An employee does not need to use this leave entitlement in one block. Leave can be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule when medically necessary. Employees must make reasonable efforts to schedule leave for planned medical treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the employer’s operations. Leave due to qualifying exigencies also may be taken on an intermittent or a reduced work schedule basis.

**Substitution of paid leave for unpaid leave.**  In order to use paid leave for FMLA leave, employees must comply with the company’s normal paid leave procedures found in the Leave policies.

Additionally, dbt Labs offers employees SDI benefits through Unum and employees may be eligible for state disability benefits and state paid family leave benefits depending on where they live. Please speak with the People Team or its delegate (including Sparrow) for more information.

**Employee responsibilities.** Employees must provide 30 days’ advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable. When 30 days’ notice is not possible, employees must provide notice as soon as practicable and generally must comply with the company’s normal notification procedures. The company may delay leave to employees who do not provide proper advance notice of the foreseeable need for leave, absent unusual circumstances preventing the notice.

Employees must provide sufficient information for the company to determine if the leave may qualify for FMLA protection and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. Sufficient information may include that the employee is unable to perform job functions, the family member is unable to perform daily activities, the need for hospitalization or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider, or circumstances supporting the need for military family leave.  Employees also must inform the company if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certified. Employees may be required to provide a certification and periodic recertification supporting the need for leave. The company also may require a second and, if necessary, a third opinion (at the company’s expense) and, when the leave is a result of the employee’s own serious health condition, a fitness-for-duty report to return to work.  The company also may delay or deny approval of leave for lack of proper medical certification.

**Company responsibilities.** The company will inform employees requesting leave whether they are eligible under the FMLA. If they are, the notice will specify any additional information required, as well as the employees’ rights and responsibilities. If employees are not eligible, the company will provide a reason for the ineligibility.

The company will inform employees if leave will be designated as FMLA-protected and the amount of leave counted against the employees’ FMLA leave entitlement. If the company determines that the leave is not FMLA-protected, the company will notify the employees.

**Other provisions.** Under an exception to the FLSA in the FMLA regulations, hourly amounts may be deducted for unpaid leave from the salary of executive, administrative, and professional employees; outside sales representatives; certain highly skilled computer professionals; and certain highly compensated employees who are exempt from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA, without affecting the employees’ exempt status. This special exception to the “salary basis” requirements for the FLSA’s exemptions extends only to eligible employees’ use of FMLA leave.

Employees may not perform work for self-employment or for any other employer during an approved leave of absence, except when the leave is for military or public service or when the company has approved the employment under its Outside Employment policy and the employees’ reason for FMLA leave does not preclude the outside employment.

**Unlawful acts by employers.** The FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer (1) to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided under the FMLA or (2) to discharge,discriminate, or retaliate against any person for opposing any practice made unlawful by the FMLA or for involvement in any proceeding under or relating to the FMLA.

The FMLA does not affect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination or supersede any state or local law or collective bargaining agreement that provides greater family or medical leave rights.

#### **Discretionary Medical Leave (ADA)**

If an employee needs to take a medical leave of absence and they’re either not eligible for or have exhausted their available medical leave under the FMLA or any applicable state law, dbt Labs may grant an unpaid leave of absence for a reasonable amount of time. This leave shall be granted on a case-by-case basis, so long as the leave does not cause an undue burden to the company. This leave runs concurrent with workers’ compensation leave, if any, unless otherwise required by law.

While on this Discretionary Medical Leave, employees also may be eligible for state disability insurance as well as STD or LTD benefits. With the exception of workers’ compensation leaves, seniority rights do not accrue while on leave.

If any employee feels they need a medical leave of absence under this policy - or any other accommodation such as extended leave, flexible work schedule or duties - they should contact the People Team to determine an appropriate reasonable accommodation.

#### **Military Leave**

Upon return from military leave, employees will retain certain rights with respect to reinstatement, seniority, layoffs, compensation, length of service promotions, and length of service pay increases, as required by applicable federal or state law. Failure to report for work within the prescribed time after completion of military service will be considered a voluntary termination.

All employees who enter military service may accumulate a total absence of 5 years and still retain employment rights.

#### **Mandatory Unpaid Leave**

dbt Labs may, in its sole discretion and unless prohibited by law, require an employee to take a leave of absence without pay.

### [Requesting a leave of absence](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Leave-of-Absence-Programs-26e6b99fa9884474ba407e8af51389eb?pvs=4#5dbdce7706de48a9bf94cd6624ad4c8c)

👉 Leaves of absence are complex. They often entail the coordination of multiple laws and the juggling of potential benefits. Some leaves are paid while others are unpaid (although may be eligible for wage supplementation).

**How To Request a Leave of Absence:** To help employees navigate their potential options dbt Labs is partnering with [Sparrow](https://trysparrow.com/), a Leave Management Partner. 

Anyone who may need to take a leave of absence should either:
a) contact their [People Business Partner Team](https://www.notion.so/7c4b9fca56e245e684bd8d8e79f65910) member, or
b) submit your request via this [**leave request form](https://form.asana.com/?k=KZqlYJHKhsQoYJvtFJXibw&d=312418853397011)** 

The People Support team will introduce you to a Sparrow Leave Specialist as soon as your leave is approved. Sparrow will schedule a call with you to discuss your leave plans, identify the key dates when they need to be involved, and gather the necessary information to file your leave paperwork on your behalf.

Employees who will be going on a leave of absence should review the related policy outlined above.

## Workplace Rental 

Working from home does not work for everyone. Employees receive a monthly benefit to rent office space and experience an optimal work environment.

### Goals/Values of Enabling Work Outside of the Home:

1. **Productivity**: dbt’s remote-first / async culture is designed to allow employees to “work from anywhere” vs just “work from home”.  The ***primary goal*** of supporting workplaces outside the home is to enable employees to build the optimal environment for their work.
2. **Inclusiveness:** In-person / outside the home workplace benefits must not compromise remote employees’ ability to collaborate.  
3. **Community:** Provide opportunities for team members to build rapport with one another, engage cross-functionally, and strengthen a sense of shared values and goals.

🖐️ Please keep in mind that the main goal of this is to enhance your personal work environment. If you choose to collaborate in a co-working space with co-workers, you are mindful that everyone who needs to be involved in a conversation is.  If your project/collaboration can be accomplished over zoom or asynchronously, then it should be done that way to avoid excluding others. 

### By enabling employees to rent workspaces outside the home to optimize productivity! We offer:

1. $250 per month in workplace rental coverage for all employees through Liquidspace 
2. $1500 per quarter workplace rental stipend for Directors (L7+) and above to book large conference room / work spaces through Liquidspace to support in-person meetings for teams

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is Liquidspace and how do I use it?

About Liquidspace:   Liquidspace is an online marketplace for renting workplaces and offices.  It is considered the “airbnb of workplace rentals”  in that it utilizes a number of companies and private hosts to allow for over 10,000 locations to choose from. Liquidspace will be a new tile added to your Okta board.  Simply login from there and begin searching. 

#### When should I use Liquidspace vs a dbt Office?

When in the vicinity / metro area of a dbt Labs office, leverage the office instead of liquidspace to the best of your ability.   If you are local to an office but the office is full or doesn’t suit your needs (e.g. you need a bigger space for a customer / team meeting) feel free to leverage liquidspace as needed. 

#### What if I want to rent a different workspace for the day that is not available on liquidspace?

We do not reimburse one-time workplace rental expense for locations outside the Liquidspace platform. 

However, if you are looking for a space and there are no viable or available options near you in LiquidSpace, and you can find space elsewhere, you may use your personal card and expense the cost up to $250/month.  Please use the expense code “Office Space” in Airbase. 

#### Can I go over my budget on liquidspace?

No - the $250 rental benefit is strictly enforced within Liquidspace.  For example, if you have used $230 of the monthly benefit, and want to book a day pass for $35, liquidspace will not process the rental. 

#### Is there an exception process if i want to rent a monthly space that is more expensive than my monthly budget?

YES! - If you are a team member who does not have an optimal at-home workplace, **and expects to be going into the office 3 times a week or more**, we want to support you in finding the right work environment! 

Most monthly subscriptions are more than the $250 limit, so liquidspace will not allow you to book on the company plan.  In order to book the space, you can use your own credit card (on liquidspace OR another platform) and then claim the $250 credit through Airbase.  You must book an unlimited monthly subscription or permanent desk at a coworking space to be eligible for the airbase refund (we do not offer this for day passes).

#### Non-US-based Employees:

LiquidSpace is available in many countries as well. If there is not a space near you on LiquidSpace, we want you to be able to work from anywhere as well!  If this is the case, you can find space elsewhere, pay for your space with your personal card and expense, per month, up to:

- $250 USD 
- €228.58 EUR
- £189.00 GBP
- $336.61 AUD 
- $364.86 NZD
- $234.17 CHF
- $318.38 CAD

#### Time Off

Sometimes people just need to disconnect from work and they should take advantage of our [Time Off Policy](#time-off-policy-1). However, there are occasions when we strongly encourage you take an extended period time off of work to care for yourself or loved ones.

If you are in a situation where you may need extended time off, you may want to consider taking a formal leave of absence. 

Reasons for LOAs vary and amounts of time can also vary (i.e. 1 month to 3 months, etc). Discuss this option in detail with your [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/People-Business-Partners-7c4b9fca56e245e684bd8d8e79f65910?pvs=4#e9211ed8d0c04cdda5ea7af9b8190e26).
