## [Compensation Principles](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/dbt-Labs-Compensation-Principles-0d570903e75e45fc8f9f3fca13a77d00?pvs=4)
Learn more about how we think about compensation at dbt Labs. Below are our compensation principles which we reference when making all compensation decisions.

### The Why

Our compensation philosophy has been arrived at over the course of many years, countless hours of conversation, and lots of on-the-ground lessons. Here are the three concerns that motivate our compensation philosophy.

1. Compensation impacts real people and has a real moral dimension. As such, our philosophy must be built from a foundation of our values.
2. Compensation directly impacts our ability to attract and retain the best talent and therefore compete in the market.
3. Compensation is the single largest cost to our business. Our comp philosophy must position us to create a long-term viable, healthy, valuable business.

### Our Compensation Philosophy

1. Values are more important than success; we do not make exceptions to our compensation policies even if that causes real near-term pain. Violation of this can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
    1. To accomplish this; outgoing offers must be discussed between hiring managers and the TA partners before being delivered to a candidate. When there are any questions or concerns, loop in the compensation partner to determine the path forward. 
    2. If you identify an instance where you feel that we are not living up to this commitment, please alert @Meg Colon immediately. 
2. Transparency always wins, and we will be as transparent as possible. 
    1. Our compensation *ranges* for a given title and level are public both internally[^1] and externally[^2]
    2. Our compensation *policies* are transparent both internally and externally[^3].
    3. We **never** disclose a single individual’s compensation for privacy reasons but do not dissuade individuals from discussing it.
3. Our compensation ranges do get updated from time to time[^4] based on:
    1. market survey data[^5] 
    2. feedback from applicants and team members
    3. candidate data.
4. We localize compensation ranges at the country level based on local market data.
    - *Why do we take this approach?*
        
        *Labor markets, benefits, pension/superannuation schemes and payroll taxes can vary greatly country to country. This approach insures that we are offering equitable (not equal) compensation in each market.*
        
5. Our compensation bands are set using the 75th percentile within our competitive landscape in each country as the **mid point** and setting the low and high points using the spreads outlined in the table below. 
    
    
    - Consistent Band Spreads
        
        **these indicate the % from midpoint used to get the high and low points of each band. The spread increases as the roles become more senior because more senior roles may be career-roles, where folks will remain and therefore require more room for growth in the band.* 
        
        Ex. L1 with a midpoint (75th percentile) of $100,000 will have a range of $90,000 - $110,000
        
        L5 with a midpoint (75th percentile) of $200,000 will have a rang of $170,000 - $230,000.
        
| Level 	| Band Spread 	|
|:-----:	|:-----------:	|
|   L1  	|     10%     	|
|   L2  	|     10%     	|
|   L3  	|    12.5%    	|
|   L4  	|    12.5%    	|
|   L5  	|     15%     	|
|   L6  	|     15%     	|
|   L7  	|    17.5%    	|
|   L8  	|    17.5%    	|
|   L9  	|    17.5%    	|

6. We do not compensate outside of our established bands—**ever**. Making exceptions to comp bands is a sure way to introduce pay inequity and is inconsistent with our diversity value.
    1. We will continue to monitor pay to ensure underrepresented groups are paid at the same rate as others in the same role / level / country.
    2. All of our compensation bands are set by our Total Rewards team using our compensation philosophies to ensure transparent and consistent compensation.
7. We offer equity for all full-time positions. This is in the form of ISOs for US-based team members[^6] and NSOs for all non-US team members.
8. We base compensation on current market data for a role / level / country. The point in the range a candidate is offered is dependent on the candidate’s experience in the market and internal pay equity. A candidate’s previous pay is not a factor in setting their compensation at dbt Labs.
    1. In competitive offer scenarios, we may leverage sign-on bonuses. This lever is reserved for special cases and used sparingly.

9. We won’t reduce compensation in role within the same market (country). A permanent or semi-permanent move to a new country will result in moving to that new local rate. More details on relocation can be found here:
    
    [Global Employment at dbt Labs](https://www.notion.so/Global-Employment-at-dbt-Labs-a0c8faf3a9234d6a83280654caff0424)
    
10. Changes in compensation may happen during the following events:
    1. For promotions, increases are based on the new role’s market range.
    2. For job changes through internal mobility you will be offered a salary in the range for the new role using the parameters outlines in #8.
    3. Everyone is eligible for an annual merit cycle in either Q4 (effective 2/1) or Q2 (effective 8/1). The cycle you are included in will be the one closest to the anniversary of your start date in your current role. Merit increases will ensure alignment to the market (by being within the entire range of the band) at your performance and experience level and resources will be allocated to top performing team members within the organization.
    4. Market adjustments are determined on an annual basis when we pull fresh market data. When we update the band for a role we will move all team members into the new salary band.
11. We strive to offer benefit packages that provide our team members with strong medical coverage regardless of their location or care needs. 
    
    [Global Benefits Strategy & Stipend](https://www.notion.so/Global-Benefits-Strategy-Stipend-03b4ebfbb278451f894a4cca46c90607)
    
12. We hire across the globe but are not location agnostic. A candidate’s time zone, the market pay in a region, proximity to users, customers, and partners, and the presence or absence of a dbt Labs legal entity can all be factors in the hiring process.

## Questions

If you have a specific question around your compensation, one of your direct reports’ compensation, or the compensation of a role that you’re hiring for, please reach out to your People Business Partner.

[^1]: This helps to ensure pay equity. It also creates an environment where compensation—so often a touchy subject!—is de-stigmatized. Talking about compensation should be straightforward; it should involve no risk and no surprises.
[^2]: This helps to ensure that candidates have aligned expectations when starting an interview process with us and helps the offer stage tremendously.
[^3]: This is a public commitment to candidates who have not yet seen a demonstration of how we live our values.
[^4]: At a minimum 1x/year, but also when certain events occur. For example, fundraising events have historically caused us to need to update our comp bands.
[^5]: We leverage data from Radford, Mercer, Carta, Pave and Options Impact.
[^6]: ISOs are specifically US-based because they are an outcome of US tax law.

## Salary Bands Philosophy

Learn more about our historical practice on how we’ve built and implemented updated salary bands as well as how that methodology has evolved.

</aside>

### **Current Pay Band Structure**

Our previous bands were developed using Options Impact data for Tech / Enterprise companies using an “All US” of companies that had raised similar amounts of $. This approach has previously served us well in our earlier stages as it aligned our bands with similar companies, at similar funding levels as well as a reflection of our widely distributed workforce. Salary Bands were then built using the **60th percentile as the bottom of the range and used the 90th percentile as top of band.**

You can find an in depth overview of our how our previous bands were developed on archived Salary Bands Page below. 

[(Archived) US Salary Bands FY23](https://www.notion.so/Archived-US-Salary-Bands-FY23-8811acc0c58c42afb1d2471ef2d3f995)

### Update to Compensation Philosophy / Band Structures

As mentioned in the[dbt Labs Compensation Principles](#Compensation-Principles), we shifted to using the 75th Percentile as the basis for the midpoint as well as using a consistent range spread based on job level. We continue to use industry specific data as well as targeting all country data sets.  This allows us to build consistency in bands as well as making the bands slightly wider. With this updated methodology, most of our bands minimums may stretch down to the 50th Percentile and the maximum’s push slightly past the 90th percentile in most if not all cases. This will allow further flexibility and utilization of an entire range for a role.

- Consistent Band Spreads
    
    **these indicate the % from midpoint used to get the high and low points of each band. The spread increases as the roles become more senior because more senior roles may be career-roles, where folks will remain and therefore require more room for growth in the band.* 
    
    Ex. L1 with a midpoint (75th percentile) of $100,000 will have a range of $90,000 - $110,000
    
    L5 with a midpoint (75th percentile) of $200,000 will have a rang of $170,000 - $230,000.
    
| Level 	| Band Spread 	|
|:-----:	|:-----------:	|
|   L1  	|     10%     	|
|   L2  	|     10%     	|
|   L3  	|    12.5%    	|

|   L5  	|     15%     	|
|   L6  	|     15%     	|
|   L7  	|    17.5%    	|
|   L8  	|    17.5%    	|
|   L9  	|    17.5%    	|

### Increased Data points

As dbt labs has continued to grow, so has our need for more robust data sources to further develop and benchmark our compensation structure to. This is a common next step as we continue to mature and evolve our compensation benchmarking practices. After evaluating a handful of data sources, we found that using a combination of the following data sets creates a solid and diverse base to build our updated ranges from (Radford, Mercer, Pave, Carta and Options Impact).

We believe that with more data we can better target [more specific roles[^7] within dbt labs as well as better navigate data outliers that are a result low counts of specific data points (ex. Small or insufficient # of companies/employees reporting salaries for a specific role & level).

Another common practice in salary band development is to assess and utilize data based on the quality and veracity of that data set. While we believe that each of the sources we are using has its own merit for use, we have chosen to use a weighting structure to develop the midpoint of our ranges instead of using a straight average. This allows us to better index on data sources like Radford and Mercer which are considered a ‘Gold standard’ data sets within the compensation community.

This will broaden our compensation data that has more robust job leveling and job matches that can scale with dbt as we continue to grow. Mercer data is cut for All US companies, SAAS companies and if there is insufficient SAAS data we have included all companies to help round out our Salary ranges with this data set.                                                                                                                                                                   	|

The Data is cut by All Us Companies with a Valuation over 1 Billion. Valuation is the recommended data cut for for Pave and provides the best comparable data to benchmark against. As with all of our data cuts we are using total cash comp (Base + Variable + Bonuses) and does not include any Stock or Options valuations.   We decided to include Pave for the exposure to high paying tech start ups which is reflected in the data. Pave is weighted at 10% due to its lack of data quality, incumbent counts as well as a less robust data source / matching scheme. 	|

Options impact has been the data that we anchored our bands to historically and continues to give exposure to to similar tech companies but as we've grown and matured it is limited in the levels, descriptions and quantity of data for other companies that we would consider peers. This data cut is Tech (enterprise) companies that have raised over $250 Million in capital and all US. Additionally this creates a layer of continuity in salary survey use but is weighted to 10% due to its limited leveling and matching data points.                                                                       	|

Their data does not cut to an all US as is our practice for data cuts so have aligned this market point with CA, Bay Area salaries. We are including this source as this data will be sourced from start ups which will continue to give direct exposure to similar start up companies. We discounted this data and gave it a 10% weighting due to the lack of All US approach / other data sifting that we would want. Lastly, Carta's data isn't overtly robust in terms of incumbents as well as depth of different matches.                                                 	|

Additionally, we have outlined the step by step process of how we go from Raw data to a refined Salary band for roles as well as the additional synthesis and analysis of the data.


[^7]: Specific Roles - Both Radford and Mercer have 100+ different jobs / roles that we can match to that allows to get more specific with the roles and duties to ensure that our role’s bands are developed using the most correlated data and skill set. This is vital to ensure we aren’t over or under targeting pay for roles that have been lumped into 1 large bucket.

## Global Compensation and Benefits

[dbt Labs Compensation Principles](#Compensation-Principles)

[Global Benefits Strategy & Stipend](/handbook/benefits.md/#Global-Benefits-Strategy-&-Stipend)

In the past, we have hired internationally using our US-based compensation bands. As we are growing that presence internationally, our approach here will have to change in order to create efficiency and scalability with our growth. To that end, we will apply our compensation philosophy to each country we employ in. 

This is because the labor markets, benefits, pension/superannuation schemes and payroll taxes can vary greatly country to country. This approach insures that we are offering equitable (not equal) compensation in each market.

We are paying **local country rates** based on [cost of market (also referred to as cost of labor)](https://www.erieri.com/blog/post/cost-of-labor-vs-cost-of-living). This means we will align our compensation with the top (75th - 90th percentile) in each country (looking at ”All UK” “All Germany”, “All Australia”, etc.)

#### Relocation (Permanent or Semi-permanent)

📌 All international relocation requests must be approved by the People team, Finance team and the team members management. To initiate a request, please contact your People Business Partner.

[People Business Partners](https://www.notion.so/People-Business-Partners-7c4b9fca56e245e684bd8d8e79f65910)

📌 Relocation requests within country may need approval by the team members management due to time zone or regional requirements. Please communicate with your manager if you plan a move to a different region in your country.


If a team member chooses to relocate within each country (ex. from London → Manchester or Boston → Chicago), their compensation will not change. However, if the relocation is to a different country, they will be re-aligned to the new country’s compensation bands. This applies both when moving to a lower and higher cost market. 

Compensation bands for each country we have an entity in will be listed in our compensation database. As we grow, new data will be added to capture roles located in each country.

**What to consider before moving?**

⏳ Please initiate a move at least 3 months before your target move date. This allows us to process necessary approvals and make sure we’re able to execute the transfer.


1. If the team member is moving to a new country, the move must have prior approval by their People Business Partner, the dbt Labs finance team, their manager and their team’s leadership.
    1. Please allow for one month for approvals.
2. All moves should be to a country where we have a dbt Labs entity. 
    1. Any international moves outside of countries we have a presence in, must be approved by the CFO and be to a location where there is a business case. We ask for a 6 month lead time to determine if this move is possible
3. Team members must obtain their own work authorization to work in the country they are moving to. For moves initiated by the team member, dbt Labs will not cover expenses for work authorization. 
4. If a move is initiated by a team member, we will not cover any relocation or living expenses. 
5. We encourage team members to consult with a tax advisor to understand the implications of the move as it relates to tax and equity. 
    1. **Please remember that your compensation will be updated to reflect the local market you are moving to.**  

### Short term relocation.

📅 Generally, team members may live or work outside their permanent residence for an aggregate amount of 183 days (6 months) per year. However, the amount does depend on the particular country (or state) and what it considers to be a "resident" for tax purposes, as well as what it considers the tax year.

Any work being done in a country where we do not have a current presence must be approved by security to ensure access to our systems remains secure. Please submit a ticket with IT prior to confirming your working arrangements in that country. 

If a team member is considering spending more than **one month** in a location outside of your home country, please consult with your People Business Partner to ensure we are mitigating risks to the team member and the business. 

Team members are expected to communicate with their manager and team to ensure they maintain agreed upon working hours.

### Equity

**ISO Options:**  If a team member chooses to relocate and holds ISO options, the number of options that are unvested will be converted to NSO options.  If the team member has options that vested as ISOs, they will be able to retain the ISO status.  When the team member relocates, the Equity team will cancel the existing ISO grant(s) and reissue NSO grant(s) for the unvested portion of the original grant within Carta.  The grant will retain all of the other original terms (strike price, vesting period, etc.)

**NSO options:**  If a team member chooses to relocate and holds NSO options, nothing will change.

There are different tax consequences for ISO and NSO options.  Additionally, tax rules vary across jurisdictions.  Employees are strongly encouraged to consult with a tax advisor before making any relocation decision.

‼️ **If there is a lapse in providing services to the Company, this will qualify as a termination and all unvested options will be canceled.  If a team member is rehired and resumes providing services to the Company, any grant associated with employment will need to go through the new hire process for equity.  This means that a team member would receive a new strike price, vesting period, etc.**


## How Salary Bands are Made

📌 Compensation & salary band development is both an art and a science and we strive to leverage data and best practice to develop bands that will allow us to both attract and retain talent. The science is the clear process of developing and selecting data to produce a target market percentage. The art is the sifting through the nuances of this imperfect data to ensure that career progression as well as cross company comparisons align.

### Process of Developing Salary Bands

#### **The Science**

1. Develop comprehensive list of Roles[^8] & levels that the team or organization has or will need in the next 12 months. 
2. Review and select the most appropriate market match for each Role across each data set.
    1. OI, Carta & Pave - Match based on Job titles lists & mini descriptions. Due to smaller data sets, data is matched more into functional buckets & titles
    2. Mercer & Radford - Matched based on robust descriptions that have a much wider breadth of options and distinctions.
3. Once jobs have been matched to the “best^9]” match with the data, we used our [weighted average approach](#Data-Sources-&-Weighted-Average-Approach) across the 5 data points to arrive at a “Raw” Recommended Midpoint.
    - Example Of Weighted Average
        
        
        | Data | Carta - 10% | Pave - 10% | Options Impact - 10% | Mercer - 30% | Radford - 40% |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | Data (75th) | $130,540.00 | $151,773.00 | $122,000.00 | $112,560.00 | $120,000.00 |
        | Weighted Amount | $13,054.00 | $15,177.30 | $12,200.00 | $33,768.00 | $48,000.00 |
        | Target Market Sum of Weighted Amounts | $122,199 |  |  |  |  |
4. We then developed the bands by Rounding the Raw midpoint to nearest $1,000 for simplicity of consumption and used our standardized salary band spread approach to build out the Min & Max from the midpoint.
    
    
    - Consistent Band Spreads
        
        **these indicate the % from midpoint used to get the high and low points of each band. The spread increases as the roles become more senior because more senior roles may be career-roles, where folks will remain and therefore require more room for growth in the band.* 
        
        Ex. L1 with a midpoint (75th percentile) of $100,000 will have a range of $90,000 - $110,000
        
        L5 with a midpoint (75th percentile) of $200,000 will have a rang of $170,000 - $230,000.
        
| Level 	| Band Spread 	|
|:-----:	|:-----------:	|
|   L1  	|     10%     	|
|   L2  	|     10%     	|
|   L3  	|    12.5%    	|
|   L4  	|    12.5%    	|
|   L5  	|     15%     	|
|   L6  	|     15%     	|
|   L7  	|    17.5%    	|
|   L8  	|    17.5%    	|
|   L9  	|    17.5%    	|

5. We then arrived at our version 1 of salary bands

#### **The Art**

1. Review data points by role to identify and remove any egregious outliers[^10].
2. Review the progression of data of a survey within a career path to identify any cross level compression that is skewing the data and expected progression (ex. L5 data > L6 data)
3. Review and analyze the updated Midpoints compared to previous Bands to see and understand the $ & % difference to ensure these changes in bands ‘make sense’ based on our updated data.

[^8]: Roles - Each functional area of the business has ‘buckets’ of work / responsibilities that are assigned various roles on the team. Different roles are developed to ensure the salary band and market data is the most appropriate to benchmark to. Additional roles are recommended if roles are more than 30% different this may be a different role in terms of ‘market value’ based on the role, duties and required skill set
[^9]: “Best” - When matching our internal roles against built descriptions within each data set, we frequently find that an 80% match agains
[^10]: Removing data outliers is a pretty standard and common practice once you start involving multiple data sources to help prevent outlier data from skewing the average due to small incumbent counts being reported

## FY24 Salary Bands

### Salary Band Overview

Salary bands in their simplest form is the compensation range for a given role within an organization. These ranges are built and developed using market data that allows companies to benchmark their roles compare to others in their industry. The market data used, is a direct reflection of a companies compensation strategy and philosophy as it determines how competitive they will be in attracting and retaining talent. As mentioned in our [dbt Labs Compensation Principles](#Compensation-Principles), we have chosen to build our salary bands using tech specific data as well using the 75th Percentile as the basis or target of our ranges (In short, this ensures that we are competing with other tech companies and that our pay should meet or exceed 75% of other companies for similar roles and level).

### How we built our salary bands?

As dbt labs has continued to grow and mature, so has our our compensation and total rewards strategy. In the following pages, you can reference a deeper dive into these changes as we’ve added 4 additional data sets and have a greater ability to more accurately benchmark specific roles instead of more functional buckets.

[How Salary Bands are Made](#How-Salary-Bands-Are-Made)

### What ranges are built?

These salary range databases are meant to include all roles +/- one level for every role we currently have filled or is on the hiring plan for each given location. This is *not* a comprehensive database of every role we will ever hire and plans may even change mid-year and we may hire roles that are not on here (at which point, they will be added). 

### How often will bands get updated?

These bands will be reviewed and updated on a annual basis during Q4 with a Q1 effective date. We can and will review specific roles / functions should the ‘market’ for these shift significantly that requires ad-hoc review and changes (example of factors that could trigger this is -  resources and research conducted by the TR team, TA’s ability to hire and fill roles, consistent candidate/ internal retention feedback).

### What is OTE and why do some roles have it?

You'll see that some roles have a note about OTE. OTE stands for ‘on target earnings’; this means that, in order to make that number, these folks need to be meet 100% of their revenue goals / metrics. Folks that have ‘OTE’ next to their comp band have ‘risk’ associated with their total cash compensation. Part of that number is base salary and the rest in variable compensation (commission) tied to revenue goals. Total rewards uses data to identify common roles that have commission eligibility as well as will work with leaders to establish any new roles that could be commission eligible.

**The breakdowns for our teams are:**

- Partnerships: 80% Base, 20% Variable
- Solutions Architecture: 70% Base, 30% Variable
- Sales Directors: 50% Base, 50% Variable
- Sales Development: 70% Base, 30% Variable
- Revenue Marketing: 80% Base, 20% Variable

### Roles & Levels

As mentioned in [How Salary Bands are Made](#How-Salary-Bands-Are-Made), the first step in building salary bands is determining all planned and existing roles. Roles describe a career path that has a common set of core responsibility and duties within a giving field of work. Levels then are used to further extrapolate the progression of expertise, complexity and scope of a role. While we will be providing a more robust framework regarding levels, for simplicity you can reference the title structure below as a generalized progression.

1. Entry-level / Associate
2. Developing
3. Proficient / Career level
4. Senior / Lead
5. Staff / Expert
6. Principal / Advisory
7. Distinguished / Strategist
