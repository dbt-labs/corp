##Fishtown Analytics Norms##

###Listen, then speak.###
We strive to be exceptional listeners, completely understanding the needs and concerns of our clients and colleagues. We fully consider alternative viewpoints before cementing our own.

###Writing > Talking.###
We prefer to develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals promote thoroughness, clarity of understanding and complete deliberation.

###Weâ€™re invested in the future of work.###
Our culture is remote-friendly and suited for a modern, productive style of work arrangement, including remote work and flexible schedules.

###We protect our colleagues.###
We seek to mitigate the negative externalities related to the "gig" economy while retaining the benefits. Even though we prefer at will and contracting-style relationships, we do our best to do right by the employees and contractors who contribute to our mission with generous compensation and, for our employees, benefits.

###We value diversity.###
People with different mindsets and experiences, working together, create better outcomes. This includes diversity of race and gender, as well as the diversity of academic, socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds as well as interests.

###Clients are our best salespeople.###
We market our services by working with amazing clients, doing amazing work for them, and asking them to spread the word. We go above and beyond for our clients to invest in our future growth.

###Values and norms are more important than success.###
We are not interested in success absent the values we are committed to. We have strongly held opinions on how a company should be built and these are non-negotiable. We do not believe that these opinions are an absolute truth, but they are an absolute truth for us.
