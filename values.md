##Fishtown Analytics Values##

###Profits are exhaust.###
We are a mission-driven company. We do not exist to make a profit; rather, revenue is a tool to help us accomplish our mission.

###Radical Transparency.###
We choose to be completely honest, especially when it is most uncomfortable or it would lead to short-term negative consequences. We believe that transparency is our north star, and that acting transparently always serves in the best interests of achieving our mission.

###Contribute to the Analytical Canon.###
The highest goal of any human is to discover new knowledge that can subsequently be built upon by others. This is the process upon which every good thing in human society has been built. We participate in this most fundamental of human endeavors by thinking in public and defaulting to open source.

###Understated Exceptionality.###
We are united by a core belief that our mission will change the world. We are humbled by the magnitude of our aims and of course the responsibilities we have to our clients and colleagues. Even still, in all we do, we act with careful restraint, expressing our exceptionality only through the quality of work.

###Mutual Respect.###
We treat all with whom we work with unquestionable respect. Our words and actions are imbued with a fundamental sense of trust in our colleagues, clients and the broader community.
