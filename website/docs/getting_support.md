## Getting Support

In an effort to ensure team members receive the support they need, we offer different options depending on the question or situation.

#### Getting Support from the People Team

1. **Ticketing System**: Ask any people-related question by tagging @helpdesk in #people-support to use our ticking system. This is your best option to get the fastest response to questions about benefits, reimbursements, stipends,  and payroll. 
2. **People Business Partners (PBP)**: This is the best option when you‚Äôre seeking confidentiality and don‚Äôt feel comfortable going to your manager. PBPs are a resource for when you may want to confidentially, or anonymously, report an issue in the workplace. They can help answer or support you with any questions, concerns, or feedback about your time at dbt Labs. 

#### Getting Support outside People Team

1. **Peer Advocate Program**: This is the best option when you‚Äôre seeking an alternative route to voice feedback or ideas about the company at large. The Peer Advocates Program is designed to provide an alternate route of communication with leadership and the team at large, for employees seeking to get feedback from peers, test ideas, or offer feedback with anonymity. 
2. **Anonymous Hotline**: This is your best option to workplace issues or suspected illegal or unethical conduct anonymously. The Anonymous Hotline offers an additional option for anonymous reporting, but please remember you can always reach out to your manager, People Business Partner, Peer Advocates or a member of leadership directly about any issues you are having. See below for more information about how to use the anonymous hotline.

## Anonymous Hotline

dbt Labs has an anonymous hotline for employees to be able to report workplace issues or *suspected illegal or unethical conduct* anonymously. 

üìå **This service is implemented to provide an additional option for anonymous reporting but please remember you can always approach your manager, People Business Partner or a member of leadership team directly about any issues you are having.** 

- Learn more about other ways you can get support [here](#getting-support). 

It is important to remember that, dbt Labs has a no-retaliation policy. This means that no team member will be retaliated against for making a complaint in good faith through any of our reporting avenues. If a team member feels they have been retaliated against, they should initiate a report through the anonymous hotline.
