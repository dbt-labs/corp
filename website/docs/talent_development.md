[Annual Review Cadence](#annual-review-cadence)

[Performance Reviews](#performance-reviews) 

[Compensation Reviews & Promotion Cycles](#compensation-reviews--promotion-cycles)

## Annual Review Cadence

🌏 *Note that all dates below are formatted by US dates, so it will be MM/DD*


### Types of Review Cycles

There are two types of review cycles at dbt Labs.

1. [Performance Reviews](#performance-reviews) 

2. [Compensation Reviews & Promotion Cycles](#compensation-reviews--promotion-cycles) 

### Using Culture Amp for reviews

We use Culture Amp for our reviews and it can be accessed through Okta or [here](https://www.cultureamp.com/).

### Cadence

👉 Each review cycle happens twice per year, meaning we have 4 cycles **total**.

Because of the relationship between performance, and compensation/ promotions, the review cycles are close together, while being separate. This also means that our operating calendar has space for large events (company kick off and Coalesce, for example) to happen without a review cycle in tandem.

### Schedule & Logistics

#### Q1 - Performance

- Reviews Q4 and Q1 performance. (11/1 - 4/30 in any year)
- Includes team members that started before 2/1 and are therefore out of their 30/60/90 day plans.
    - Managers that started after 2/1 will still be responsible for reviewing any eligible team members. They should consult with the team members’ former manager and, if applicable, may add them as a collaborator on the review.
- Everyone will have two weeks to write and complete their reviews (including peer and upwards feedback, if you choose to opt into this). The following month will be when you have a dedicated conversation with your manager to go over everything that was submitted as part of the performance review.

**Meetings**

- **IC reviews**: managers to repurpose a 1:1 meeting in June
- **People manager reviews**: people managers are scheduled with a third person nominated by their manager, most commonly the team member's skip-level manager.

**Time commitment estimation:**

- **IC:** 3 hours total: 2 hours of writing; self, peer (optional), upward (optional). 1 hour of meeting time
- **Managers:** 2 hours per team member (including writing, calibration, meeting prep and the meeting) Time commitment should not exceed 20 hours over 2 months (6.25%)

#### Q2 - Compensation & Promotion

- Eligible team members started in their current role before 5/1 the previous year

## Performance Reviews

📌 We conduct performance reviews twice a year, in Q1 and Q3. 

### Process Overview

#### Cadence

ℹ️ Performance reviews happen every 6 months and are full “360 reviews”. Performance reviews are done within Culture Amp (which can be accessed via your Okta portal). Culture Amp is our official system of record for performance and engagement.

The performance review consists of a self reflection, peer feedback (optional), upwards feedback (optional), and manager review. 

- Everyone can nominate who they would like to receive peer feedback from.
    - We recommend nominating minimum 2, no more than 5 peers
    - Your manager will need to assign peer feedback requests
    - It’s highly encouraged for people to submit peer feedback when requested, *but if you do not have the time or feel you do not have sufficient feedback to provide, you are welcome to decline giving feedback in a given cycle.*
- Everyone will be requested to submit upwards feedback about their manager (and this will go to your skip level manager to see; it helps them write their assessment of your manager) however know *this is also completely optional.* Your skip level may share your written feedback with your manager.
- At minimum everyone needs to submit the self-reflection (and if you are a people manager, the manager review for your team members).

#### Purpose

ℹ️ We believe in a continuous feedback culture at dbt Labs. The bi-annual performance reviews are meant to be an intentional check-in to ensure everyone is on track with regards to their development and growth path. You should also know, very clearly, how you are performing in your current role at the end of the review cycle.

While an overview of how you are doing in your role is an *element* of the review meeting, it’s also an opportunity for us to learn about what aspects of the role you enjoy the most and how you would like to see your career grow.

It should be a dedicated conversation around topics you might not be able to get to or dive in deep during your regular check-ins.

We support development, and there is a [development tool](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/How-We-Develop-Talent-at-dbt-Labs-5f5e2a6b54b5428d93c0c991ecd923e9) we have available for managers and employees to utilize.

Ideally, nothing written or discussed in your performance review is a surprise. Our expectation is immediate and consistent feedback is given throughout the year and not only during review season. So why have reviews if we’re expected to give consistent feedback? For many reasons, these more official checkpoints in the year help us with accountability, to summarize that feedback, give us moments to pause and appreciate wins together, and sets aside dedicated spotlight to development conversations.

#### Schedule & Time Commitment

Learn more about the schedule and logistics for our reviews [here](#schedule--logistics) where you'll find [Q1 Performance Review Schedule](#q1---performance) and [Q3 Performance Review Schedule](#q3---performance).

### Meetings & Conversations

ℹ️ Managers are responsible for ensuring:

- reviews are shared with each team member (please share the written reviews 1 day before the scheduled review meeting), and;
- review meetings happens within the designated month

For all individuals: this meeting will just be you and your manager (ideally, you’re just expanding an existing 1:1 to talk about reviews).
    - If your work is more cross functional (i.e. you’re embedded on another team), the leader from the other function might be the most suitable to join you and your manager in your performance review.

### Details

#### Performance Definitions

| Evaluation | Definition | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sets a New Standard | Far exceeds expectations. | This person consistently delivers on and exceeds all the expectations and goals of the role. This person demonstrates an exceptional expertise in their areas of responsibilities.  Their quality of work is at the point where others learn that something new/innovation is still possible to be achieved in the context of this role. They influence others to perform and behave better. They consistently exemplify dbt Labs values. |
| Often Exceeds Expectations | Regularly exceeds expectations. | This person consistently delivers on all the core expectations and goals for the role. They either do things at a quality level beyond what was scoped or specified OR the positive impact of the work is larger than what was anticipated. They consistently exemplify dbt Labs values. |
| Consistently Meets Expectations | Consistently meets expectations and sometimes exceeds expectations. | This person delivers on a majority of the core expectations and goals for the role. They consistently exemplify dbt Labs values. This person is doing what they were hired to do. |
| Needs Development | Not consistently delivering on expectations of role. | This person requires additional direction and support in order to get essential parts of the role done. This person isn’t able to show consistent results expected for the role to produce. Receiving a “needs development” means active coaching is needed; the manager will need to be more prescriptive about the areas needing change and will need to outline clear next steps for the person to develop into their current role. |
| Not applicable (absent for a majority of the review period) | Neutral evaluation | This person was gone for 4 or more out of the 6 months we are evaluating for this period. |

#### Calibration

ℹ️ Calibration sessions are held with department leaders and their People Business Partner. These sessions happen after reviews are written and before any meetings or feedback is shared with the team member.

The objective of calibration sessions is to ensure that different managers apply similar standards in measuring and evaluating the performance of our team. All team members get a fair and objective performance evaluation. 

1. **Increase review accuracy.** Unfortunately, one manager’s idea of a top performer might differ wildly from another’s - a difference that can dramatically hurt one team and help another. This is a risk because, come promotion and raise time, one manager’s team will have a significant leg up while the other’s chances will suffer. Calibration ensures reviews are more consistent and accurate.
2. **Properly acknowledge and reward high performance.** Once the bar is set, managers can evaluate employees with more certainty and ensure everyone on their team gets the recognition and reward they deserve.
3. **Reduce bias.** When managers rate their direct reports in a vacuum, they can only compare their direct reports to other teammates or their own idea of what performance should be. Without a calibration discussion, a manager might let unconscious bias influence their decisions and prevent specific reports from receiving a fair review.

- **The calibration process generally operates this way**:
    - All managers submit their performance review feedback and evaluations by the end of the written cycle deadline.
    - Leaders in each org meet as a group to calibrate on their ICs — this meeting is facilitated by the People Business Partner.
    - The e-team also receives all the evaluations and meets to review and discuss the performance review evaluation distribution across the org and their direct reports.
    
    **Prior to calibration sessions, senior leaders in each org should understand the feedback for all team members in their org. This may mean reviewing with a frontline manager on your team 1:1 to discuss their team, if they will not be included in the calibration session. Please work with your People Business Partner to determine who will be in the calibration session.** 
    
    We will be using Culture Amp to facilitate the calibration sessions.

## Compensation Reviews & Promotion Cycles

📌 We offer promotion and compensation cycles twice a year, in Q2 and Q4. Any changes will be effective on 8/1 and 2/1 respectively, aligning with our fiscal halves. Having 2 cycles per year is meant to give ample opportunity to reward team members.

**Please make sure to review our [compensation principles](compensation.md#compensation-principles) in order to understand how we think about compensation at dbt Labs.**

### Compensation Reviews

As a general rule, every team member will be eligible for **one** merit compensation review per year*. The cycle each team member is included in will be the cycle **closest** to the start date of the role they are currently in. This will either be their start date with the company or the start date in a new role through promotion or internal mobility.  See the table below to determine who is included in each cycle. 

**Exceptions will be made very rarely with CFO and Head of People approval.*

- Overview of your compensation review based on start month:
    
| Start Month | Cycle Breakdown |
|---|---|
| January | Q4 |
| February* | Q4 |
| March | Q4 |
| April | Q4 |
| May | Q2 |
| June | Q2 |
| July | Q2 |
| August | Q2 |
| September | Q2 |
| October | Q2 |
| November | Q4 (+1 year) |
| December | Q4 (+1 year) |

- We encourage team members to understand when their individual compensation review is so that they can prepare to have the conversations with their manager.

#### Process Overview

Ahead of the cycle, the People Business Partner and Compensation Team will produce a packet of all team members within the eligibility window for merit (minimum of 9 months since starting in their current role **or** 1 year since their last merit increase). The packet will also include merit budget and % recommendations based on performance. 

Managers will propose merit increases for eligible team members. This process will be open for 2 weeks.

**All merit increases must remain in the bounds of the compensation range for the role the team member is currently in.** 

All proposed increases will be reviewed in calibration meetings with leaders in each org to ensure internal equity and keeping in our budget. *Any increases greater than 10% will need CFO approval.* 

Detailed schedule [here](#schedule--logistics).

### Promotion Cycles

As a general rule, team members are eligible for a promotion if they meet a 1 year tenure guideline* AND have shown that they are ready for the next step in their career. This is up to the manager discretion. 

**Exceptions will be made very rarely with CFO and Head of People approval.*

#### Promotion Packets

In order to request a promotion, the manager is responsible for gathering:

➡️ We recommend gathering this feedback through 1:1 conversations and performance review feedback and compiling the notes to include in your “formal” packet.

1️⃣ at least 1 current peer review, providing feedback at their current level over, at least, the last 6 months, 

2️⃣ at least 1 review from a peer at the level they would be promoted to focusing on areas where they are already contributing at the next level (**if there is no one at the new level, a member of that team’s leadership team should be included*) to and,

3️⃣ a minimum of 3 reviews **total** to support the promotion application (**if the person up for promotion manages a team, the third review should be an upward review from a member of their team. Otherwise the 3rd review can be a statement of support from a member of that team’s leadership team*). 

We will create a promotion template in Culture Amp that includes:

- **Justification, if any, for a promotion into a more senior role:** does the business or team *need* someone in an expanded role right now? Is there higher scope or needs that they are currently filling or doing? This should be especially important at the senior and staff level and above.
- **Impact to the business in the last 12 months:** since folks get promoted no more frequently than once a year, we want to take their entire prior year into account when constructing promo packets. This should include quantitative impact statements, quotes from peers, customers, prior performance review data, etc.
- **Examples of how this person is ready for an expanded role:** here, the manager describes behaviors that an individual has shown consistently that tell us they are already operating at the next level.

- The following metadata will already exist in Culture Amp and will be pulled by the People Team:
    - A summary of ratings from the past 12 months of review cycles to paint a picture of the persons trajectory
    - Their tenure at company + time in current role

Promotions will be reviewed and approved in calibration sessions with each org.
