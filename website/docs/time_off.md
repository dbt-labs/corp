## Time Off Policy

In alignment with our core value, **“We Work Hard and Go Home”**, dbt Labs offers unlimited paid time off to support you to recharge, spend time with your family, and/or take care of personal matters. To encourage you to turn off your brain, travel, and spend time with your family, recommend you take a *minimum* amount of vacation days **(2 weeks, aka 10 business days)** each calendar year. 

- We estimate that 4 weeks in a year is a good amount to take off (this is based on what we have seen historically). Note though that we do not have a cap on the number of days you can take off for Personal Time Off.
- At the end of each quarter, the People team will send managers a list of how much time off each person has already taken / planned to take for the rest of the year (based on what is requested in ADP).
- We encourage managers to do check-ins with their team (based on the data provided above): for those not taking time off, managers should seek to understand why this is the case and to help their team member structure their workload or work priorities in a way that allows them to actually disconnect from work to recharge.

We ask that you input your time-off requests into ADP and categorize them accordingly [based on the definitions below](#%EF%B8%8F-types-of-time-off-plans--definitions). 

**Please discuss your time-off schedule with your manager prior to taking the time off so we can plan for coverage while you are out**. **Manager approval will be required to take time off!** When planning your time off, we ask that you also be mindful of the major dates and deadlines that may be unique and critical to your role.

When in doubt, please discuss with your manager about your plans.

#### When would time off be declined?

- It shows blatant abuse of the unlimited time off policy. For example (but not limited to the following):
    - Using open vacation in place of a leave of absence (see below).
    - Requesting time off that is more than 4 consecutive weeks in duration.
- Amount of (or dates of request for) PTO negatively impacts your team or the company, as determined by your manager.
- Performance is affected negatively.

#### ➡️ Types of time off plans & definitions

👉 If you need to take more than 2 consecutive weeks off, your manager or a member of the People team will reach out to see if a Leave of Absence may need to be utilized instead to support you through your specific life event.

- **Personal Time Off**:  If you are taking vacation or need to take time off work to attend to other personal matters.
- **Sick Time:** If your time off is related to your own illness or a family member’s illness (i.e. care for another family member or taking them to see the doctor), or for you to go see a medical professional. You can also use this category for a mental health day.
- **Jury Duty/Voting**: If your time off is due to jury duty or voting time.
- **Bereavement:** If you need to take off to grieve for a loss you have experienced or to support someone during the grieving process.
- **Volunteer/Service**: If your time off is related to volunteering or community service activities.
- **Other country specific categories**: As dbt Labs has presence in multiple countries, we can’t categorize every mandatory time off type. If your time off is not due to one of the above, please use the “Other” reason code in ADP and put in the comments what it is.
- **Leaves of Absences:** If you need to be absent for an extended period of time due to any reason, it may be better to consider taking a leave of absence. Examples of different paid leave of absence types and policy documents can be found below (paid leave below indicates 100% base and commission payments during these durations):
    
    [Leave of Absence Programs](#leave-of-absence-programs) 
    
    - ***Paid Parental Leave** - to be taken within the first year of parenthood; any dbt Labs employee who needs to care for a newborn as a result of birth or adoption is able to take up to 16 weeks of paid leave*
    - ***Paid Medical Leave** - any dbt Labs employee who needs to take dedicated time off to recover from their own medical event (i.e. physical or mental illness, surgery, etc) is able to take up to 4 weeks of paid leave*
    - ***Paid Caregiver Leave -** any dbt Labs employee who needs to take dedicated time off to care for a seriously ill person is able to take up to 4 weeks of paid leave*
- **Company Holidays**: dbt Labs observes a number of public and company holidays every year, and this schedule varies by country public holidays. See [Company Holidays ](#company-holidays) for days observed. You are asked to observe your local holidays (for the country you reside in).

Note that because, in the United States, your time off is not accrued, you will not be paid out for any unused time offered under this policy when your employment with dbt Labs ends.

For international employees, see [below]([#-international-considerations-for-accrued-time-and-pay-out-upon-termination-with-the-company) for respective details.

#### 💪 Best practices for being out of the office 

1️⃣ We recommend that after your time off request has been approved, to note you will be “Out of Office” on your Google Calendar (and make this event public so people can see).

Google Calendar also has an “Out of Office” feature where they can auto-decline any event that is scheduled during the period you are out. This may be helpful for you to set up!

Additionally, some teams may have team time off calendars within Google Calendar. Talk to your manager if this is something your team has; you may be asked to make your out of office dates visible here to help create visibility with your teammates. 

2️⃣ Update your Slack status to out of office, see tips [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/How-to-Slack-805c4284f1004ff39daa18cf564e02dc?pvs=4#ae7b15500281418aad995902ef5a6e8a). 

3️⃣ Set up an “out of office” auto response to your email for the dates you will be out, and clearly indicate who someone should contact instead.

### Requesting time off

Learn how to request time off in ADP [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Time-Off-Policy-cb5363a73ca1485dbf94619c4c57aa6f?pvs=4#b819ac73f9994db6a5f4572571b44cc5). 

**Note that if you are employed through Remote.com, you will need to request your time off in the Remote platform.** 

Please discuss your time off schedule ahead of time with your manager, as they do not have visibility into requests within the Remote platform.

#### 🌐 International considerations for accrued time and pay out upon termination with the company

In your employment contracts, you will see that you are eligible for a specific number of annual leave (or holiday) days to be accrued over the course of the plan year (to be used as personal time off). There is a clause in your contracts that once your annual leave (or holiday) entitlements have been used up, you are eligible to take an unlimited number of days, as long as you have manager approval. 

From a logistical standpoint, what you can expect in ADP:

- Your time off balance will show as being accrued on a month to month basis.
    - For new joiners, if you start before the 15th of that month, you will earn an accrual for the first month.
    - For new joiners, if you start after the 15th, you don’t earn anything for that month and instead will begin accruing the full amount the following month.
    - If a carryover balance is allowed in your employment contract, the maximum accrual is 25 days and then will stop accruing.
- You can actually take whatever days off you would like (subject to manager approval) even if your balance in the system does not show you have enough days accrued. It is acceptable have a negative balance as a result of taking time you have not yet accrued.

At the end of your employment with dbt Labs, if you have unused time off accrued in ADP, we will pay that amount out to you in your final paycheck.

- If your time off balance is negative, note that we will not deduct any amounts from your final paycheck

**🌍 If you are employed through Remote.com**

The above explanation of how accrued time works and is paid out upon termination is the same for Remote employees. This is because, in your contracts, you still have a set number of days that is shown. You can take any days off as long as you have manager approval.

## Company Holidays

In addition to our unlimited vacation policy, dbt Labs observes a number of public and company holidays every year, this schedule varies by country. You are asked to observe your local holidays (for the country you reside in).

We recognize that there are many other cultural, religious or location based holidays and encourage our team members to work with their manager to take the time they need.

Employee's who are contracted via an Employer of Record (i.e. Remote.com) Please reference the list of public holidays provided via Remote's Platform.

### Paid Parental Leave

**Time off & Pay**

**Time off & Pay**

dbt Labs provides all employees who become new parents, including employees who adopt a child or become a foster parent to a new child, with sixteen (16) weeks of Parental Leave paid at 100% of their base salary, to commence at the beginning of the first leave period OR the day the child is born or placed in their care. Employees may take this leave intermittently, which means taking leave in increments of time. For commission eligible employees, intermittent leaves may be taken in increments of four (4) weeks and greater. For all other employees, intermittent leaves may be taken in increments of no less than two (2) weeks.

If an employee is eligible for any benefits through dbt Labs or state sponsored plans during their leave period, the employee is required to apply for these benefits. dbt Labs will coordinate with these benefits, meaning that dbt Labs will pay the difference of the base salary and any benefits granted, not to exceed 100% of your base salary. Parental leave granted under this policy runs concurrent with any legally required family medical leave taken by eligible employees. Parental leave must be completed within 12-months of the date of birth.

Any unused leave offered under this policy will not be paid out at termination of employment, so dbt Labs encourages employees to use this benefit during the time that they are eligible.

Employees in jurisdictions that have laws with greater parental leave entitlements will be eligible for the full amount of leave required by law, and are responsible for providing sufficient advance notice as required by law. The leave amounts under this policy will run concurrent with any locally required leave plans.

*Birthing parents are eligible to use our Paid Medical Leave & unpaid leave, prior to starting the 16 weeks parental leave period. Parental leave may start immediately following the conclusion of their Paid Medical leave. Read about our Paid Medical Leave for more information.

**Health Insurance**

If employees and their families participate in dbt Labs’s group health plan, the company will maintain coverage during paid leave under this policy on the same terms as if employees had continued to work, subject to the terms of the plan.

**Vesting**

Stock options will continue to vest at their regular rate during paid or unpaid leave. 

**Return to Work**

Employees returning from Parental Leave will be reinstated to the same position, or if that position is no longer available, an equivalent position. Employees will receive pay and benefits equivalent to those received prior to their leave.

**Planning for Parental Leave**

We understand that exact timing can't always be planned so, as early as possible, please start working with your manager and your team to plan for your leave. This includes:

- Planning projects to wrap up ahead of leave and avoiding taking on new large projects right before.
- Assigning owners for your day to day work and beginning to train and hand-off work as needed.
- Documenting as much as possible to set your team up for success while you're gone.
- As soon as your leave is approved contact your People Business Partner to initiate the process with our leave management partner, Sparrow.

### Paid Medical Leave

**Time off & Pay**

Employees who are unable to work for more than ten (10) business days due to a serious health condition (defined below) may be eligible for paid medical leave based on a physician’s recommendation. dbt Labs will provide up to four (4) weeks total of paid medical leave per medical condition, up to a maximum of eight (8) total weeks of paid medical leave every twelve (12) months. If eligible, employees must apply for any state and/or Unum disability benefits. dbt Labs will coordinate with these benefits, meaning that dbt Labs will pay the difference of your base salary and any benefits granted not to exceed 100% of your base salary. Medical leave granted under this policy runs concurrent with any family medical leave or any other medical leave taken by eligible employees, as provided by law. 

Team members whose serious health condition extends beyond the 4 weeks of Paid Medical Leave, will transition to our unpaid leave policy, but may be eligible to receive disability benefits via Unum and other state benefits.

A medical leave is considered a paid leave for a specific serious health condition. As such, employees may be eligible for more than one paid medical leave in a year, depending on their unique circumstances. Note that while an employee may be approved for more than one paid medical leave in a year (because they experience more than one serious health condition that necessitates time off), this benefit is capped at a total of 8 weeks of paid leave within any 12- month periods.

**Health Insurance**

If employees participate in dbt Labs’s group health plan, the company will maintain coverage during paid leave under this policy on the same terms as if employees had continued to work, subject to the terms of the plan.

**Vesting**

Stock options will continue to vest at their regular rate during paid or unpaid leave. 

**Return to Work**

Employees may be asked to provide a Fitness for Duty form completed by their medical provider prior to their first day back to certify that they are released to return to work with or without restrictions. Employees returning from medical leave will be reinstated to the same position, or if that position is no longer available, an equivalent position. Employees will receive pay and benefits equivalent to those received prior to their leave. Employees who require job-related accommodations should contact their People Business Partner.

**Planning for Medical Leave**

We understand that exact timing can't always be planned so, as early as possible, please start working with your manager and your team to plan for your leave. This includes:

- Planning projects to wrap up ahead of leave and avoiding taking on new large projects right before.
- Assigning owners for your day to day work and beginning to train and hand-off work as needed.
- Documenting as much as possible to set your team up for success while you're gone.
- As soon as your leave is approved contact your People Business Partner to initiate the process with our leave management partner, Sparrow.

Reach out to your [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Find-your-PBP-f54e1de2eefa413bad7eb251a3a7c19f) if you have questions about how to plan for your leave.

### Paid Caregiver Leave

Employees who need to take dedicated time off to care for a seriously ill or injured person will be allowed to take up to 4 weeks of paid Caregiver Leave. The illness or injury must be a serious health condition (defined below).

Certain personal relationships may be eligible for wage replacement programs through the state. For example, a caregiver leave for caring for a parent, child, or sibling, is eligible for wage replacement through a Paid Family Leave program. In those cases, employees are required to file a paid family leave claim. dbt Labs will coordinate with these benefits to ensure that employees receive 100% pay.

A serious health condition is an illness, an injury, an impairment, or a physical or mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider for a condition that either prevents the qualified family member from participating in school, work, or other daily activities. Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a healthcare provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment, incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of “continuing treatment.”

Under some circumstances, employees may take this leave intermittently, which means taking leave in blocks of time or reducing the employee's normal weekly or daily work schedule. An employee may take leave intermittently whenever it is medically necessary to care for a seriously ill individual. Leave taken intermittently may be taken in increments of no less than one week.

### Paid Leave for Pregnancy Loss

Employees who experience or have a partner who experiences a miscarriage or pregnancy loss are eligible for two (2) weeks of leave paid at 100% of their base salary. In the event that the employee experiences medical difficulties beyond this time frame, they may be eligible for a Medical Leave.

### Paid Bereavement Leave

In accordance with dbt Labs’ open time off policy, employees already are able to take up to two (2) weeks of Bereavement Time Off to grieve for a loss of life. If additional time is needed beyond the two (2) weeks, employees will be eligible to take an additional two (2) weeks to grieve under Paid Bereavement Leave on a case-by-case basis.

Time off granted in accordance with this policy shall not be credited as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime.

### Unpaid Leave (US)

We offer the following types of unpaid leave: Medical Leave (FMLA), Discretionary Medical Leave (ADA), Military Leave, and Mandatory Unpaid Leave.

#### Medical Leave (FMLA)

dbt Labs complies with the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which requires employers to grant unpaid leaves of absence to qualified workers for certain medical and family-related reasons. The company also abides by any state and local leave laws. The more generous of the laws will apply to the employee if the employee is eligible under both federal and state laws.

Please note there are many requirements, qualifications, and exceptions under these laws, and each employee’s situation is different. Contact the People Team to discuss options for leave.

The FMLA requires private employers with 50 or more employees and all public agencies, including state, local, and federal employers, and local education agencies (schools) to provide eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in any 12-month period for certain family and medical reasons. The 12-month period is a rolling period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave, except for leaves to care for a covered service member with a serious illness or injury. For those leaves, the leave entitlement is 26 weeks in a single 12-month period measured forward from the date an employee first takes that type of leave.

- **Employee eligibility.** The FMLA defines eligible employees as employees who (1) have worked for the company for at least 12 months; (2) have worked for the company for at least 1,250 hours in the previous 12 months; and (3) work at or report to a worksite that has 50 or more employees or is within 75 miles of company worksites that, taken together, have a total of 50 or more employees. *(75 Miles radius waived due to fully remote & distributed workforce)*

- **Basic leave entitlement.** The FMLA requires covered employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to eligible employees for the following reasons: (1) for incapacity due to pregnancy, prenatal medical care, or childbirth; (2) to care for the employee’s child after birth or placement for adoption or foster care; (3) to care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition; or (4) for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to work.

- **Military family leave entitlements.** Eligible employees with a spouse, child, or parent on active duty or called to active duty status in the National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation may use their 12-week leave entitlement to address certain qualifying exigencies.  Qualifying exigencies may include addressing issues that arise from (1) short notice of deployment (limited to up to 7 days of leave); (2) attending certain military events and related activity; (3) arranging child care and school activities; (4) addressing certain financial and legal arrangements; (5) attending certain counseling sessions; (6) spending time with covered military family members on short-term temporary rest and recuperation leave (limited to up to 5 days of leave); (7) attending post deployment reintegration briefings; (8) arranging care for or providing care to a parent who is incapable of self-care; and (9) any additional activities agreed upon by the employer and employee that arise out of the military member’s active duty or call to active duty.

The FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a covered servicemember during a single 12-month period. A covered servicemember is a current member of the armed forces, including a member of the National Guard or reserves, who has a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render the servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of the servicemember’s office, grade, rank, or rating and for which the servicemember is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy; is in outpatient status; or is on the temporary disability retired list.

- **Benefits and protections during FMLA leave.** During FMLA leave, the company will maintain the employee’s health coverage under any group health plan on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If applicable, employees must make arrangements to pay their share of health plan premiums while on unpaid leave. In some instances, dbt Labs may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage or other benefits for employees and/or their families. Upon return from FMLA leave, most employees will be restored to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms.  However, an employee on FMLA leave does not have any greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave period.

Certain highly compensated key employees also may be denied reinstatement when necessary to prevent “substantial and grievous economic injury” to the company’s operations. A “key” employee is an eligible salaried employee who is among the highest-paid 10 percent of the company’s employees within 75 miles of the worksite. Employees will be notified of their status as key employees, when applicable, after they request FMLA leave.

Use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued before the start of an employee’s leave.

- **Definition of “serious health condition.”** A serious health condition is an illness, an injury, an impairment, or a physical or mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee’s job or prevents the qualified family member from participating in school, work, or other daily activities.

Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a healthcare provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment, incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of “continuing treatment.”

- **Use of leave.** An employee does not need to use this leave entitlement in one block. Leave can be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule when medically necessary. Employees must make reasonable efforts to schedule leave for planned medical treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the employer’s operations. Leave due to qualifying exigencies also may be taken on an intermittent or a reduced work schedule basis.

- **Substitution of paid leave for unpaid leave.**  In order to use paid leave for FMLA leave, employees must comply with the company’s normal paid leave procedures found in the Leave policies.

Additionally, dbt Labs offers employees SDI benefits through UNUM and employees may be eligible for state disability benefits and state paid family leave benefits depending on where they live. Please speak with the People Team or its delegate (including Sparrow) for more information.

- **Employee responsibilities.** Employees must provide 30 days’ advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable. When 30 days’ notice is not possible, employees must provide notice as soon as practicable and generally must comply with the company’s normal notification procedures. The company may delay leave to employees who do not provide proper advance notice of the foreseeable need for leave, absent unusual circumstances preventing the notice.

Employees must provide sufficient information for the company to determine if the leave may qualify for FMLA protection and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. Sufficient information may include that the employee is unable to perform job functions, the family member is unable to perform daily activities, the need for hospitalization or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider, or circumstances supporting the need for military family leave.  Employees also must inform the company if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certified. Employees may be required to provide a certification and periodic recertification supporting the need for leave. The company also may require a second and, if necessary, a third opinion (at the company’s expense) and, when the leave is a result of the employee’s own serious health condition, a fitness-for-duty report to return to work.  The company also may delay or deny approval of leave for lack of proper medical certification.

- **Company responsibilities.** The company will inform employees requesting leave whether they are eligible under the FMLA. If they are, the notice will specify any additional information required, as well as the employees’ rights and responsibilities. If employees are not eligible, the company will provide a reason for the ineligibility.

The company will inform employees if leave will be designated as FMLA-protected and the amount of leave counted against the employees’ FMLA leave entitlement. If the company determines that the leave is not FMLA-protected, the company will notify the employees.

- **Other provisions.** Under an exception to the FLSA in the FMLA regulations, hourly amounts may be deducted for unpaid leave from the salary of executive, administrative, and professional employees; outside sales representatives; certain highly skilled computer professionals; and certain highly compensated employees who are exempt from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA, without affecting the employees’ exempt status. This special exception to the “salary basis” requirements for the FLSA’s exemptions extends only to eligible employees’ use of FMLA leave.

Employees may not perform work for self-employment or for any other employer during an approved leave of absence, except when the leave is for military or public service or when the company has approved the employment under its Outside Employment policy and the employees’ reason for FMLA leave does not preclude the outside employment.

- **Unlawful acts by employers.** The FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer (1) to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided under the FMLA or (2) to discharge, discriminate, or retaliate against any person for opposing any practice made unlawful by the FMLA or for involvement in any proceeding under or relating to the FMLA.

The FMLA does not affect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination or supersede any state or local law or collective bargaining agreement that provides greater family or medical leave rights.

#### Discretionary Medical Leave (ADA)

If an employee needs to take a medical leave of absence and they’re either not eligible for or have exhausted their available medical leave under the FMLA or any applicable state law, dbt Labs may grant an unpaid leave of absence for a reasonable amount of time. This leave shall be granted on a case-by-case basis, so long as the leave does not cause an undue burden to the company. This leave runs concurrent with workers’ compensation leave, if any, unless otherwise required by law.

While on this Discretionary Medical Leave, employees also may be eligible for state disability insurance as well as STD or LTD benefits. With the exception of workers’ compensation leaves, seniority rights do not accrue while on leave.

If any employee feels they need a medical leave of absence under this policy - or any other accommodation such as extended leave, flexible work schedule or duties - they should contact the People Team to determine an appropriate reasonable accommodation.

#### Military Leave

Upon return from military leave, employees will retain certain rights with respect to reinstatement, seniority, layoffs, compensation, length of service promotions, and length of service pay increases, as required by applicable federal or state law. Failure to report for work within the prescribed time after completion of military service will be considered a voluntary termination.

All employees who enter military service may accumulate a total absence of 5 years and still retain employment rights.

#### Mandatory Unpaid Leave

dbt Labs may, in its sole discretion and unless prohibited by law, require an employee to take a leave of absence without pay.

### Requesting a Leave of Absence

Leaves of absence are complex. They often entail the coordination of multiple laws and the juggling of potential benefits. Some leaves are paid while others are unpaid (although may be eligible for wage supplementation).
